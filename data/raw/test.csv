100257,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.70,TROILUS,"Although my will distaste what it elected,"
100258,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.71,TROILUS,The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
100259,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.72,TROILUS,To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
100260,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.73,TROILUS,"We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,"
100261,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.74,TROILUS,"When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands"
100262,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.75,TROILUS,"We do not throw in unrespective sieve,"
100263,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.76,TROILUS,Because we now are full. It was thought meet
100264,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.77,TROILUS,Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
100265,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.78,TROILUS,"Your breath of full consent bellied his sails,"
100266,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.79,TROILUS,"The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce"
100267,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.80,TROILUS,"And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,"
100268,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.81,TROILUS,"And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,"
100269,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.82,TROILUS,"He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness"
100270,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.83,TROILUS,"Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning."
100271,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.84,TROILUS,Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
100272,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.85,TROILUS,"Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,"
100273,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.86,TROILUS,"Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,"
100274,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.87,TROILUS,And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
100275,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.88,TROILUS,If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
100276,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.89,TROILUS,"As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--"
100277,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.90,TROILUS,If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
100278,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.91,TROILUS,"As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands"
100279,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.92,TROILUS,And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
100280,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.93,TROILUS,"The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,"
100281,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.94,TROILUS,"And do a deed that fortune never did,"
100282,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.95,TROILUS,Beggar the estimation which you prized
100283,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.96,TROILUS,"Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,"
100284,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.97,TROILUS,That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
100285,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.98,TROILUS,"But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,"
100286,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.99,TROILUS,"That in their country did them that disgrace,"
100287,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.100,TROILUS,We fear to warrant in our native place!
100288,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,2.2.101,CASSANDRA,"[Within]  Cry, Trojans, cry!"
100289,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,2.2.102,PRIAM,What noise? what shriek is this?
100290,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,2.2.103,TROILUS,"'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice."
100291,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,2.2.104,CASSANDRA,"[Within]  Cry, Trojans!"
100292,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,2.2.105,HECTOR,It is Cassandra.
100293,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,,HECTOR,"Enter CASSANDRA, raving"
100294,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,2.2.106,CASSANDRA,"Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,"
100295,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,2.2.107,CASSANDRA,And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
100296,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,2.2.108,HECTOR,"Peace, sister, peace!"
100297,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.109,CASSANDRA,"Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,"
100298,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.110,CASSANDRA,"Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,"
100299,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.111,CASSANDRA,Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
100300,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.112,CASSANDRA,A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
100301,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.113,CASSANDRA,"Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!"
100302,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.114,CASSANDRA,"Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand,"
100303,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.115,CASSANDRA,"Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all."
100304,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.116,CASSANDRA,"Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:"
100305,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.117,CASSANDRA,"Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go."
100306,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,,CASSANDRA,Exit
100307,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.118,HECTOR,"Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains"
100308,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.119,HECTOR,Of divination in our sister work
100309,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.120,HECTOR,Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
100310,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.121,HECTOR,"So madly hot that no discourse of reason,"
100311,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.122,HECTOR,"Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,"
100312,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.123,HECTOR,Can qualify the same?
100313,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.124,TROILUS,"Why, brother Hector,"
100314,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.125,TROILUS,We may not think the justness of each act
100315,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.126,TROILUS,"Such and no other than event doth form it,"
100316,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.127,TROILUS,"Nor once deject the courage of our minds,"
100317,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.128,TROILUS,Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
100318,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.129,TROILUS,Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
100319,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.130,TROILUS,Which hath our several honours all engaged
100320,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.131,TROILUS,"To make it gracious. For my private part,"
100321,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.132,TROILUS,I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
100322,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.133,TROILUS,And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
100323,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.134,TROILUS,Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
100324,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.135,TROILUS,To fight for and maintain!
100325,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.136,PARIS,Else might the world convince of levity
100326,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.137,PARIS,As well my undertakings as your counsels:
100327,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.138,PARIS,"But I attest the gods, your full consent"
100328,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.139,PARIS,Gave wings to my propension and cut off
100329,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.140,PARIS,All fears attending on so dire a project.
100330,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.141,PARIS,"For what, alas, can these my single arms?"
100331,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.142,PARIS,"What Propugnation is in one man's valour,"
100332,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.143,PARIS,To stand the push and enmity of those
100333,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.144,PARIS,"This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,"
100334,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.145,PARIS,Were I alone to pass the difficulties
100335,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.146,PARIS,"And had as ample power as I have will,"
100336,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.147,PARIS,"Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,"
100337,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.148,PARIS,Nor faint in the pursuit.
100338,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,2.2.149,PRIAM,"Paris, you speak"
100339,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,2.2.150,PRIAM,Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
100340,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,2.2.151,PRIAM,"You have the honey still, but these the gall,"
100341,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,2.2.152,PRIAM,So to be valiant is no praise at all.
100342,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.153,PARIS,"Sir, I propose not merely to myself"
100343,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.154,PARIS,"The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,"
100344,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.155,PARIS,But I would have the soil of her fair rape
100345,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.156,PARIS,"Wiped off, in honourable keeping her."
100346,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.157,PARIS,"What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,"
100347,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.158,PARIS,"Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,"
100348,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.159,PARIS,Now to deliver her possession up
100349,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.160,PARIS,On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
100350,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.161,PARIS,That so degenerate a strain as this
100351,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.162,PARIS,Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
100352,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.163,PARIS,There's not the meanest spirit on our party
100353,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.164,PARIS,Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
100354,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.165,PARIS,"When Helen is defended, nor none so noble"
100355,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.166,PARIS,Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
100356,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.167,PARIS,"Where Helen is the subject, then, I say,"
100357,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.168,PARIS,"Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,"
100358,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.169,PARIS,The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
100359,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.170,HECTOR,"Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,"
100360,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.171,HECTOR,And on the cause and question now in hand
100361,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.172,HECTOR,"Have glozed, but superficially: not much"
100362,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.173,HECTOR,"Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought"
100363,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.174,HECTOR,Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
100364,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.175,HECTOR,The reasons you allege do more conduce
100365,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.176,HECTOR,To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
100366,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.177,HECTOR,Than to make up a free determination
100367,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.178,HECTOR,"'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge"
100368,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.179,HECTOR,Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
100369,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.180,HECTOR,Of any true decision. Nature craves
100370,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.181,HECTOR,"All dues be render'd to their owners: now,"
100371,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.182,HECTOR,What nearer debt in all humanity
100372,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.183,HECTOR,Than wife is to the husband? If this law
100373,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.184,HECTOR,"Of nature be corrupted through affection,"
100374,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.185,HECTOR,"And that great minds, of partial indulgence"
100375,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.186,HECTOR,"To their benumbed wills, resist the same,"
100376,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.187,HECTOR,There is a law in each well-order'd nation
100377,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.188,HECTOR,To curb those raging appetites that are
100378,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.189,HECTOR,Most disobedient and refractory.
100379,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.190,HECTOR,"If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,"
100380,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.191,HECTOR,"As it is known she is, these moral laws"
100381,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.192,HECTOR,Of nature and of nations speak aloud
100382,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.193,HECTOR,To have her back return'd: thus to persist
100383,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.194,HECTOR,"In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,"
100384,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.195,HECTOR,But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
100385,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.196,HECTOR,"Is this in way of truth, yet ne'ertheless,"
100386,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.197,HECTOR,"My spritely brethren, I propend to you"
100387,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.198,HECTOR,"In resolution to keep Helen still,"
100388,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.199,HECTOR,For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
100389,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.200,HECTOR,Upon our joint and several dignities.
100390,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.201,TROILUS,"Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:"
100391,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.202,TROILUS,Were it not glory that we more affected
100392,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.203,TROILUS,"Than the performance of our heaving spleens,"
100393,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.204,TROILUS,I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
100394,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.205,TROILUS,"Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,"
100395,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.206,TROILUS,"She is a theme of honour and renown,"
100396,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.207,TROILUS,"A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,"
100397,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.208,TROILUS,"Whose present courage may beat down our foes,"
100398,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.209,TROILUS,"And fame in time to come canonize us,"
100399,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.210,TROILUS,"For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose"
100400,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.211,TROILUS,So rich advantage of a promised glory
100401,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.212,TROILUS,As smiles upon the forehead of this action
100402,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,2.2.213,TROILUS,For the wide world's revenue.
100403,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,2.2.214,HECTOR,"I am yours,"
100404,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,2.2.215,HECTOR,You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
100405,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,2.2.216,HECTOR,I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
100406,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,2.2.217,HECTOR,The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
100407,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,2.2.218,HECTOR,Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
100408,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,2.2.219,HECTOR,"I was advertised their great general slept,"
100409,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,2.2.220,HECTOR,Whilst emulation in the army crept:
100410,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,2.2.221,HECTOR,"This, I presume, will wake him."
100411,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,,HECTOR,Exeunt
100412,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,,HECTOR,SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
100413,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,,HECTOR,"Enter THERSITES, solus"
100414,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.1,THERSITES,"How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of"
100415,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.2,THERSITES,thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
100416,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.3,THERSITES,"beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!"
100417,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.4,THERSITES,"would it were otherwise, that I could beat him,"
100418,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.5,THERSITES,"whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to"
100419,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.6,THERSITES,"conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of"
100420,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.7,THERSITES,"my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a"
100421,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.8,THERSITES,rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
100422,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.9,THERSITES,"undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of"
100423,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.10,THERSITES,"themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,"
100424,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.11,THERSITES,"forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,"
100425,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.12,THERSITES,"Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy"
100426,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.13,THERSITES,"caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less"
100427,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.14,THERSITES,than little wit from them that they have! which
100428,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.15,THERSITES,short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
100429,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.16,THERSITES,"scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly"
100430,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.17,THERSITES,"from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and"
100431,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.18,THERSITES,"cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the"
100432,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.19,THERSITES,"whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,"
100433,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.20,THERSITES,"methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war"
100434,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.21,THERSITES,for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
100435,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,2.3.22,THERSITES,say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!
100436,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,,THERSITES,Enter PATROCLUS
100437,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.3.23,PATROCLUS,"Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail."
100438,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.24,THERSITES,"If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou"
100439,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.25,THERSITES,wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
100440,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.26,THERSITES,"it is no matter, thyself upon thyself! The common"
100441,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.27,THERSITES,"curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in"
100442,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.28,THERSITES,"great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and"
100443,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.29,THERSITES,discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
100444,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.30,THERSITES,direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
100445,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.31,THERSITES,"out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and"
100446,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.32,THERSITES,sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.
100447,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.3.33,THERSITES,Amen. Where's Achilles?
100448,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,2.3.34,PATROCLUS,"What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?"
100449,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.3.35,THERSITES,Ay: the heavens hear me!
100450,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,,THERSITES,Enter ACHILLES
100451,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,2.3.36,ACHILLES,Who's there?
100452,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,2.3.37,PATROCLUS,"Thersites, my lord."

100456,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.3.41,THERSITES,"Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,"
100457,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.3.42,THERSITES,what's Achilles?
100458,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,2.3.43,PATROCLUS,"Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,"
100459,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,2.3.44,PATROCLUS,what's thyself?
100460,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,2.3.45,THERSITES,"Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,"
100461,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,2.3.46,THERSITES,what art thou?
100462,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,2.3.47,PATROCLUS,Thou mayst tell that knowest.
100463,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,2.3.48,ACHILLES,"O, tell, tell."
100464,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,2.3.49,THERSITES,I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
100465,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,2.3.50,THERSITES,"Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am Patroclus'"
100466,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,2.3.51,THERSITES,"knower, and Patroclus is a fool."
100467,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,2.3.52,PATROCLUS,You rascal!
100468,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,2.3.53,THERSITES,"Peace, fool! I have not done."
100469,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.3.54,ACHILLES,"He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites."
100470,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.3.55,THERSITES,"Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool, Thersites"
100471,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.3.56,THERSITES,"is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool."
100472,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.3.57,ACHILLES,"Derive this, come."
100473,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.3.58,THERSITES,"Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles,"
100474,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.3.59,THERSITES,"Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon,"

100477,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,2.3.62,PATROCLUS,Why am I a fool?
100478,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.3.63,THERSITES,Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou
100479,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.3.64,THERSITES,"art. Look you, who comes here?"
100480,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.3.65,ACHILLES,"Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody."
100481,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.3.66,ACHILLES,"Come in with me, Thersites."
100482,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,,ACHILLES,Exit

100491,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,2.3.73,PATROCLUS,"Within his tent, but ill disposed, my lord."
100492,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,2.3.74,AGAMEMNON,Let it be known to him that we are here.
100493,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,2.3.75,AGAMEMNON,"He shent our messengers, and we lay by"
100494,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,2.3.76,AGAMEMNON,"Our appertainments, visiting of him:"
100495,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,2.3.77,AGAMEMNON,"Let him be told so, lest perchance he think"

100497,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,2.3.79,AGAMEMNON,Or know not what we are.
100498,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,2.3.80,PATROCLUS,I shall say so to him.
100499,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,,PATROCLUS,Exit
100500,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,2.3.81,ULYSSES,We saw him at the opening of his tent:
100501,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,2.3.82,ULYSSES,He is not sick.
100502,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,2.3.83,AJAX,"Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it"
100503,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,2.3.84,AJAX,"melancholy, if you will favour the man, but, by my"
100504,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,2.3.85,AJAX,"head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the"

100506,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,,AJAX,Takes AGAMEMNON aside
100507,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,2.3.87,NESTOR,What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
100508,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,2.3.88,ULYSSES,Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
100509,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,2.3.89,NESTOR,"Who, Thersites?"
100510,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,2.3.90,ULYSSES,He.
100511,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,2.3.91,NESTOR,"Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument."
100512,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,2.3.92,ULYSSES,"No, you see, he is his argument that has his"
100513,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,2.3.93,ULYSSES,"argument, Achilles."
100514,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,2.3.94,NESTOR,"All the better, their fraction is more our wish than"
100515,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,2.3.95,NESTOR,their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
100516,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,2.3.96,NESTOR,could disunite.
100517,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,2.3.97,ULYSSES,"The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily"

100519,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,,ULYSSES,Re-enter PATROCLUS
100520,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,2.3.99,NESTOR,No Achilles with him.
100521,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,2.3.100,ULYSSES,"The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:"
100522,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,2.3.101,ULYSSES,"his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure."
100523,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,2.3.102,PATROCLUS,"Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,"
100524,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,2.3.103,PATROCLUS,If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
100525,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,2.3.104,PATROCLUS,Did move your greatness and this noble state

100527,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,2.3.106,PATROCLUS,"But for your health and your digestion sake,"
100528,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,2.3.107,PATROCLUS,And after-dinner's breath.
100529,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.108,AGAMEMNON,"Hear you, Patroclus:"
100530,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.109,AGAMEMNON,We are too well acquainted with these answers:
100531,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.110,AGAMEMNON,"But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,"
100532,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.111,AGAMEMNON,Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
100533,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.112,AGAMEMNON,"Much attribute he hath, and much the reason"
100534,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.113,AGAMEMNON,"Why we ascribe it to him, yet all his virtues,"
100535,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.114,AGAMEMNON,"Not virtuously on his own part beheld,"
100536,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.115,AGAMEMNON,"Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,"
100537,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.116,AGAMEMNON,"Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,"
100538,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.117,AGAMEMNON,"Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,"
100539,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.118,AGAMEMNON,"We come to speak with him, and you shall not sin,"
100540,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.119,AGAMEMNON,If you do say we think him over-proud
100541,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.120,AGAMEMNON,"And under-honest, in self-assumption greater"
100542,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.121,AGAMEMNON,"Than in the note of judgment, and worthier"
100543,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.122,AGAMEMNON,than himself
100544,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.123,AGAMEMNON,"Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,"
100545,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.124,AGAMEMNON,"Disguise the holy strength of their command,"
100546,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.125,AGAMEMNON,And underwrite in an observing kind
100547,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.126,AGAMEMNON,"His humorous predominance, yea, watch"
100548,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.127,AGAMEMNON,"His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if"
100549,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.128,AGAMEMNON,The passage and whole carriage of this action
100550,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.129,AGAMEMNON,"Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,"
100551,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.130,AGAMEMNON,"That if he overhold his price so much,"
100552,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.131,AGAMEMNON,"We'll none of him, but let him, like an engine"
100553,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.132,AGAMEMNON,"Not portable, lie under this report:"
100554,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.133,AGAMEMNON,"'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:"
100555,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.134,AGAMEMNON,A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
100556,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.135,AGAMEMNON,Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
100557,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,2.3.136,PATROCLUS,"I shall, and bring his answer presently."
100558,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,,PATROCLUS,Exit
100559,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,2.3.137,AGAMEMNON,"In second voice we'll not be satisfied,"
100560,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,2.3.138,AGAMEMNON,"We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you."
100561,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,,AGAMEMNON,Exit ULYSSES
100562,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,2.3.139,AJAX,What is he more than another?
100563,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,2.3.140,AGAMEMNON,No more than what he thinks he is.
100564,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,2.3.141,AJAX,Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
100565,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,2.3.142,AJAX,better man than I am?
100566,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,2.3.143,AGAMEMNON,No question.
100567,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,2.3.144,AJAX,"Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?"
100568,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,2.3.145,AGAMEMNON,"No, noble Ajax, you are as strong, as valiant, as"
100569,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,2.3.146,AGAMEMNON,"wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether"
100570,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,2.3.147,AGAMEMNON,more tractable.
100571,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,2.3.148,AJAX,Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
100572,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,2.3.149,AJAX,know not what pride is.
100573,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.150,AGAMEMNON,"Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the"
100574,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.151,AGAMEMNON,fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
100575,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.152,AGAMEMNON,"his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle,"
100576,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.153,AGAMEMNON,"and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours"
100577,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.154,AGAMEMNON,the deed in the praise.
100578,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,2.3.155,AJAX,"I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads."
100579,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,2.3.156,NESTOR,Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
100580,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,,NESTOR,Aside
100581,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,,NESTOR,Re-enter ULYSSES
100582,Troilus and Cressida,55.0,2.3.157,ULYSSES,Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
100583,Troilus and Cressida,56.0,2.3.158,AGAMEMNON,What's his excuse?
100584,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,2.3.159,ULYSSES,"He doth rely on none,"
100585,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,2.3.160,ULYSSES,But carries on the stream of his dispose
100586,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,2.3.161,ULYSSES,"Without observance or respect of any,"
100587,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,2.3.162,ULYSSES,In will peculiar and in self-admission.
100588,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,2.3.163,AGAMEMNON,Why will he not upon our fair request
100589,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,2.3.164,AGAMEMNON,Untent his person and share the air with us?
100590,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.165,ULYSSES,"Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,"
100591,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.166,ULYSSES,"He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,"
100592,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.167,ULYSSES,And speaks not to himself but with a pride
100593,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.168,ULYSSES,That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
100594,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.169,ULYSSES,Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
100595,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.170,ULYSSES,That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
100596,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.171,ULYSSES,Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
100597,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.172,ULYSSES,And batters down himself: what should I say?
100598,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.173,ULYSSES,He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
100599,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.174,ULYSSES,Cry 'No recovery.'
100600,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,2.3.175,AGAMEMNON,Let Ajax go to him.
100601,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,2.3.176,AGAMEMNON,"Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:"
100602,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,2.3.177,AGAMEMNON,"'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led"
100603,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,2.3.178,AGAMEMNON,At your request a little from himself.
100604,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.179,ULYSSES,"O Agamemnon, let it not be so!"
100605,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.180,ULYSSES,We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
100606,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.181,ULYSSES,When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
100607,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.182,ULYSSES,That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
100608,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.183,ULYSSES,And never suffers matter of the world
100609,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.184,ULYSSES,"Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve"
100610,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.185,ULYSSES,"And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd"
100611,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.186,ULYSSES,Of that we hold an idol more than he?
100612,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.187,ULYSSES,"No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord"
100613,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.188,ULYSSES,"Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,"
100614,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.189,ULYSSES,"Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,"
100615,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.190,ULYSSES,"As amply titled as Achilles is,"
100616,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.191,ULYSSES,By going to Achilles:
100617,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.192,ULYSSES,That were to enlard his fat already pride
100618,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.193,ULYSSES,And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
100619,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.194,ULYSSES,With entertaining great Hyperion.
100620,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.195,ULYSSES,"This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,"
100621,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.196,ULYSSES,And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
100622,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,2.3.197,NESTOR,"[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O, this is well, he rubs the"
100623,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,2.3.198,NESTOR,vein of him.
100624,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,2.3.199,DIOMEDES,[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks up
100625,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,2.3.200,DIOMEDES,this applause!
100626,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,2.3.201,AJAX,"If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face."
100627,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,2.3.202,AGAMEMNON,"O, no, you shall not go."
100628,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,2.3.203,AJAX,"An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:"
100629,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,2.3.204,AJAX,Let me go to him.
100630,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,2.3.205,ULYSSES,Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
100631,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,2.3.206,AJAX,"A paltry, insolent fellow!"
100632,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,2.3.207,NESTOR,How he describes himself!
100633,Troilus and Cressida,70.0,2.3.208,AJAX,Can he not be sociable?
100634,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,2.3.209,ULYSSES,The raven chides blackness.
100635,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,2.3.210,AJAX,I'll let his humours blood.
100636,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,2.3.211,AGAMEMNON,He will be the physician that should be the patient.
100637,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,2.3.212,AJAX,"An all men were o' my mind,--"
100638,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,2.3.213,ULYSSES,Wit would be out of fashion.
100639,Troilus and Cressida,76.0,2.3.214,AJAX,"A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:"
100640,Troilus and Cressida,76.0,2.3.215,AJAX,shall pride carry it?
100641,Troilus and Cressida,77.0,2.3.216,NESTOR,"An 'twould, you'ld carry half."
100642,Troilus and Cressida,78.0,2.3.217,ULYSSES,A' would have ten shares.
100643,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,2.3.218,AJAX,"I will knead him, I'll make him supple."
100644,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,2.3.219,NESTOR,He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:
100645,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,2.3.220,NESTOR,"pour in, pour in, his ambition is dry."

100676,Troilus and Cressida,93.0,2.3.251,ULYSSES,"As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,"
100677,Troilus and Cressida,93.0,2.3.252,ULYSSES,"You should not have the eminence of him,"
100678,Troilus and Cressida,93.0,2.3.253,ULYSSES,But be as Ajax.

100841,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,3.1.142,PARIS,"Or force of Greekish sinews, you shall do more"
100842,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,3.1.143,PARIS,"Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector."
100843,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,3.1.144,HELEN,"'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris,"
100844,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,3.1.145,HELEN,"Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty"
100845,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,3.1.146,HELEN,"Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,"
100846,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,3.1.147,HELEN,"Yea, overshines ourself."

100850,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,,PARIS,"Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting"
100851,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.2.1,PANDARUS,How now! where's thy master? at my cousin
100852,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.2.2,PANDARUS,Cressida's?
100853,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,3.2.3,Boy,"No, sir, he stays for you to conduct him thither."
100854,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.2.4,PANDARUS,"O, here he comes."
100855,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,,PANDARUS,Enter TROILUS
100856,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.2.5,PANDARUS,"How now, how now!"
100857,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.2.6,TROILUS,"Sirrah, walk off."
100858,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,,TROILUS,Exit Boy
100859,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,3.2.7,PANDARUS,Have you seen my cousin?
100860,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.8,TROILUS,"No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,"
100861,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.9,TROILUS,Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
100862,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.10,TROILUS,"Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,"
100863,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.11,TROILUS,And give me swift transportance to those fields
100864,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.12,TROILUS,Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
100865,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.13,TROILUS,"Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,"
100866,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.14,TROILUS,From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
100867,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.15,TROILUS,And fly with me to Cressid!
100868,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.2.16,PANDARUS,"Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight."
100869,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,,PANDARUS,Exit
100870,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.17,TROILUS,"I am giddy, expectation whirls me round."
100871,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.18,TROILUS,The imaginary relish is so sweet
100872,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.19,TROILUS,"That it enchants my sense: what will it be,"
100873,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.20,TROILUS,When that the watery palate tastes indeed
100874,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.21,TROILUS,"Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,"
100875,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.22,TROILUS,"Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,"
100876,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.23,TROILUS,"Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,"
100877,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.24,TROILUS,For the capacity of my ruder powers:
100878,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.25,TROILUS,"I fear it much, and I do fear besides,"
100879,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.26,TROILUS,"That I shall lose distinction in my joys,"
100880,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.27,TROILUS,"As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps"
100881,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.28,TROILUS,The enemy flying.
100882,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,,TROILUS,Re-enter PANDARUS
100883,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.29,PANDARUS,"She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you"
100884,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.30,PANDARUS,"must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches"
100885,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.31,PANDARUS,"her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a"
100886,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.32,PANDARUS,sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest
100887,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.33,PANDARUS,villain: she fetches her breath as short as a
100888,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.34,PANDARUS,new-ta'en sparrow.
100889,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,,PANDARUS,Exit
100890,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.2.35,TROILUS,Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:
100891,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.2.36,TROILUS,"My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,"
100892,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.2.37,TROILUS,"And all my powers do their bestowing lose,"
100893,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.2.38,TROILUS,Like vassalage at unawares encountering
100894,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.2.39,TROILUS,The eye of majesty.
100895,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,,TROILUS,Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA
100896,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.40,PANDARUS,"Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby."
100897,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.41,PANDARUS,Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that
100898,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.42,PANDARUS,"you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?"
100899,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.43,PANDARUS,"you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?"
100900,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.44,PANDARUS,"Come your ways, come your ways, an you draw backward,"
100901,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.45,PANDARUS,we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to
100902,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.46,PANDARUS,"her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your"
100903,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.47,PANDARUS,"picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend"
100904,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.48,PANDARUS,"daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner."
100905,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.49,PANDARUS,"So, so, rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!"
100906,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.50,PANDARUS,"a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter, the air"
100907,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.51,PANDARUS,"is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere"
100908,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.52,PANDARUS,"I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the"
100909,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.2.53,PANDARUS,"ducks i' the river: go to, go to."
100910,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,3.2.54,TROILUS,"You have bereft me of all words, lady."
100911,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,3.2.55,PANDARUS,"Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll"
100912,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,3.2.56,PANDARUS,"bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your"
100913,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,3.2.57,PANDARUS,"activity in question. What, billing again? Here's"
100914,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,3.2.58,PANDARUS,'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--
100915,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,3.2.59,PANDARUS,"Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire."
100916,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,,PANDARUS,Exit
100917,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,3.2.60,CRESSIDA,"Will you walk in, my lord?"
100918,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,3.2.61,TROILUS,"O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!"
100919,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,3.2.62,CRESSIDA,"Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!"
100920,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,3.2.63,TROILUS,What should they grant? what makes this pretty
100921,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,3.2.64,TROILUS,abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet
100922,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,3.2.65,TROILUS,lady in the fountain of our love?
100923,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,3.2.66,CRESSIDA,"More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes."
100924,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,3.2.67,TROILUS,"Fears make devils of cherubims, they never see truly."
100925,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,3.2.68,CRESSIDA,"Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer"
100926,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,3.2.69,CRESSIDA,footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
100927,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,3.2.70,CRESSIDA,fear the worst oft cures the worse.
100928,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,3.2.71,TROILUS,"O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's"
100929,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,3.2.72,TROILUS,pageant there is presented no monster.
100930,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,3.2.73,CRESSIDA,Nor nothing monstrous neither?
100931,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.74,TROILUS,"Nothing, but our undertakings, when we vow to weep"
100932,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.75,TROILUS,"seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers, thinking"
100933,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.76,TROILUS,it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
100934,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.77,TROILUS,enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
100935,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.78,TROILUS,"This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will"
100936,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.79,TROILUS,"is infinite and the execution confined, that the"
100937,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.80,TROILUS,desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.
100938,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.2.81,CRESSIDA,They say all lovers swear more performance than they
100939,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.2.82,CRESSIDA,are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
100940,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.2.83,CRESSIDA,"perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and"
100941,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.2.84,CRESSIDA,discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
100942,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.2.85,CRESSIDA,"that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,"
100943,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.2.86,CRESSIDA,are they not monsters?
100944,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.87,TROILUS,Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
100945,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.88,TROILUS,"are tasted, allow us as we prove, our head shall go"
100946,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.89,TROILUS,bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
100947,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.90,TROILUS,shall have a praise in present: we will not name
100948,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.91,TROILUS,"desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition"
100949,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.92,TROILUS,shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
100950,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.93,TROILUS,shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
100951,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.94,TROILUS,"shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can"
100952,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.95,TROILUS,speak truest not truer than Troilus.
100953,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,3.2.96,CRESSIDA,"Will you walk in, my lord?"
100954,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,,CRESSIDA,Re-enter PANDARUS
100955,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.2.97,PANDARUS,"What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?"
100956,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.2.98,CRESSIDA,"Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you."
100957,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.2.99,PANDARUS,"I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,"
100958,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.2.100,PANDARUS,you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
100959,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.2.101,PANDARUS,"flinch, chide me for it."
100960,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,3.2.102,TROILUS,"You know now your hostages, your uncle's word and my"
100961,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,3.2.103,TROILUS,firm faith.
100962,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.2.104,PANDARUS,"Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,"
100963,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.2.105,PANDARUS,"though they be long ere they are wooed, they are"
100964,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.2.106,PANDARUS,"constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you,"
100965,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.2.107,PANDARUS,they'll stick where they are thrown.
100966,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,3.2.108,CRESSIDA,"Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart."
100967,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,3.2.109,CRESSIDA,"Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day"
100968,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,3.2.110,CRESSIDA,For many weary months.
100969,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.2.111,TROILUS,Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
100970,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.112,CRESSIDA,"Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,"
100971,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.113,CRESSIDA,With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
100972,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.114,CRESSIDA,"If I confess much, you will play the tyrant."
100973,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.115,CRESSIDA,"I love you now, but not, till now, so much"
100974,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.116,CRESSIDA,"But I might master it: in faith, I lie,"
100975,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.117,CRESSIDA,"My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown"
100976,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.118,CRESSIDA,"Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!"
100977,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.119,CRESSIDA,"Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,"
100978,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.120,CRESSIDA,When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
100979,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.121,CRESSIDA,"But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not,"
100980,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.122,CRESSIDA,"And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,"
100981,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.123,CRESSIDA,Or that we women had men's privilege
100982,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.124,CRESSIDA,"Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,"
100983,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.125,CRESSIDA,For in this rapture I shall surely speak
100984,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.126,CRESSIDA,"The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,"
100985,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.127,CRESSIDA,"Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws"
100986,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.128,CRESSIDA,My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.
100987,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.2.129,TROILUS,"And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence."
100988,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.2.130,PANDARUS,"Pretty, i' faith."
100989,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,3.2.131,CRESSIDA,"My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me,"
100990,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,3.2.132,CRESSIDA,"'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:"
100991,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,3.2.133,CRESSIDA,I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
100992,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,3.2.134,CRESSIDA,"For this time will I take my leave, my lord."
100993,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,3.2.135,TROILUS,"Your leave, sweet Cressid!"
100994,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,3.2.136,PANDARUS,"Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--"
100995,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.2.137,CRESSIDA,"Pray you, content you."
100996,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.2.138,TROILUS,"What offends you, lady?"
100997,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,3.2.139,CRESSIDA,"Sir, mine own company."
100998,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,3.2.140,TROILUS,You cannot shun Yourself.
100999,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.2.141,CRESSIDA,Let me go and try:
101000,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.2.142,CRESSIDA,"I have a kind of self resides with you,"
101001,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.2.143,CRESSIDA,"But an unkind self, that itself will leave,"
101002,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.2.144,CRESSIDA,To be another's fool. I would be gone:
101003,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.2.145,CRESSIDA,Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
101004,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,3.2.146,TROILUS,Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
101005,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.2.147,CRESSIDA,"Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love,"
101006,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.2.148,CRESSIDA,"And fell so roundly to a large confession,"
101007,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.2.149,CRESSIDA,"To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,"
101008,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.2.150,CRESSIDA,"Or else you love not, for to be wise and love"
101009,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.2.151,CRESSIDA,"Exceeds man's might, that dwells with gods above."
101010,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.152,TROILUS,O that I thought it could be in a woman--
101011,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.153,TROILUS,"As, if it can, I will presume in you--"
101012,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.154,TROILUS,"To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love,"
101013,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.155,TROILUS,"To keep her constancy in plight and youth,"
101014,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.156,TROILUS,"Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind"
101015,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.157,TROILUS,That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
101016,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.158,TROILUS,"Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,"
101017,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.159,TROILUS,That my integrity and truth to you
101018,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.160,TROILUS,Might be affronted with the match and weight
101019,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.161,TROILUS,"Of such a winnow'd purity in love,"
101020,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.162,TROILUS,"How were I then uplifted! but, alas!"
101021,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.163,TROILUS,I am as true as truth's simplicity
101022,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.164,TROILUS,And simpler than the infancy of truth.
101023,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.2.165,CRESSIDA,In that I'll war with you.
101024,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.166,TROILUS,"O virtuous fight,"
101025,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.167,TROILUS,When right with right wars who shall be most right!
101026,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.168,TROILUS,True swains in love shall in the world to come
101027,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.169,TROILUS,"Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,"
101028,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.170,TROILUS,"Full of protest, of oath and big compare,"
101029,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.171,TROILUS,"Want similes, truth tired with iteration,"

101034,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.176,TROILUS,"As truth's authentic author to be cited,"

101036,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.178,TROILUS,And sanctify the numbers.

101042,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.184,CRESSIDA,And mighty states characterless are grated

101068,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,,PANDARUS,"Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHAS"
101069,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.1,CALCHAS,"Now, princes, for the service I have done you,"
101070,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.2,CALCHAS,The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
101071,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.3,CALCHAS,To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
101072,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.4,CALCHAS,"That, through the sight I bear in things to love,"
101073,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.5,CALCHAS,"I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,"
101074,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.6,CALCHAS,"Incurr'd a traitor's name, exposed myself,"
101075,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.7,CALCHAS,"From certain and possess'd conveniences,"
101076,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.8,CALCHAS,"To doubtful fortunes, sequestering from me all"
101077,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.9,CALCHAS,"That time, acquaintance, custom and condition"
101078,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.10,CALCHAS,"Made tame and most familiar to my nature,"
101079,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.11,CALCHAS,"And here, to do you service, am become"
101080,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.12,CALCHAS,"As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:"
101081,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.13,CALCHAS,"I do beseech you, as in way of taste,"
101082,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.14,CALCHAS,"To give me now a little benefit,"
101083,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.15,CALCHAS,"Out of those many register'd in promise,"
101084,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.16,CALCHAS,"Which, you say, live to come in my behalf."
101085,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,3.3.17,AGAMEMNON,"What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand."
101086,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.18,CALCHAS,"You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,"
101087,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.19,CALCHAS,Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
101088,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.20,CALCHAS,Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
101089,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.21,CALCHAS,"Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,"
101090,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.22,CALCHAS,"Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,"
101091,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.23,CALCHAS,"I know, is such a wrest in their affairs"
101092,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.24,CALCHAS,"That their negotiations all must slack,"
101093,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.25,CALCHAS,"Wanting his manage, and they will almost"
101094,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.26,CALCHAS,"Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,"
101095,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.27,CALCHAS,"In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,"
101096,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.28,CALCHAS,"And he shall buy my daughter, and her presence"
101097,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.29,CALCHAS,"Shall quite strike off all service I have done,"
101098,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.30,CALCHAS,In most accepted pain.
101099,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.31,AGAMEMNON,"Let Diomedes bear him,"
101100,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.32,AGAMEMNON,And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
101101,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.33,AGAMEMNON,"What he requests of us. Good Diomed,"
101102,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.34,AGAMEMNON,Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
101103,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.35,AGAMEMNON,Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
101104,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.36,AGAMEMNON,Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
101105,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,3.3.37,DIOMEDES,"This shall I undertake, and 'tis a burden"
101106,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,3.3.38,DIOMEDES,Which I am proud to bear.
101107,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,,DIOMEDES,Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS
101108,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,,DIOMEDES,"Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent"
101109,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.39,ULYSSES,Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
101110,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.40,ULYSSES,"Please it our general to pass strangely by him,"
101111,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.41,ULYSSES,"As if he were forgot, and, princes all,"
101112,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.42,ULYSSES,Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
101113,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.43,ULYSSES,I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
101114,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.44,ULYSSES,Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
101115,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.45,ULYSSES,"If so, I have derision medicinable,"
101116,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.46,ULYSSES,"To use between your strangeness and his pride,"
101117,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.47,ULYSSES,Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
101118,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.48,ULYSSES,It may be good: pride hath no other glass
101119,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.49,ULYSSES,"To show itself but pride, for supple knees"
101120,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.50,ULYSSES,Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
101121,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.51,AGAMEMNON,"We'll execute your purpose, and put on"
101122,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.52,AGAMEMNON,A form of strangeness as we pass along:
101123,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.53,AGAMEMNON,"So do each lord, and either greet him not,"
101124,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.54,AGAMEMNON,"Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more"
101125,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.55,AGAMEMNON,Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
101126,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.3.56,ACHILLES,"What, comes the general to speak with me?"
101127,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.3.57,ACHILLES,"You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy."
101128,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.3.58,AGAMEMNON,What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
101129,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.3.59,NESTOR,"Would you, my lord, aught with the general?"
101130,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.3.60,ACHILLES,No.
101131,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,3.3.61,NESTOR,"Nothing, my lord."
101132,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,3.3.62,AGAMEMNON,The better.
101133,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,,AGAMEMNON,Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR
101134,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,3.3.63,ACHILLES,"Good day, good day."
101135,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,3.3.64,MENELAUS,How do you? how do you?
101136,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,,MENELAUS,Exit
101137,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,3.3.65,ACHILLES,"What, does the cuckold scorn me?"
101138,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,3.3.66,AJAX,"How now, Patroclus!"
101139,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,3.3.67,ACHILLES,"Good morrow, Ajax."
101140,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,3.3.68,AJAX,Ha?
101141,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,3.3.69,ACHILLES,Good morrow.
101142,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,3.3.70,AJAX,"Ay, and good next day too."
101143,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,,AJAX,Exit
101144,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,3.3.71,ACHILLES,What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
101145,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.3.72,PATROCLUS,They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
101146,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.3.73,PATROCLUS,"To send their smiles before them to Achilles,"
101147,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.3.74,PATROCLUS,To come as humbly as they used to creep
101148,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.3.75,PATROCLUS,To holy altars.
101149,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.76,ACHILLES,"What, am I poor of late?"
101150,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.77,ACHILLES,"'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,"
101151,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.78,ACHILLES,Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
101152,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.79,ACHILLES,He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
101153,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.80,ACHILLES,"As feel in his own fall, for men, like butterflies,"
101154,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.81,ACHILLES,"Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,"
101155,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.82,ACHILLES,"And not a man, for being simply man,"
101156,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.83,ACHILLES,"Hath any honour, but honour for those honours"
101157,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.84,ACHILLES,"That are without him, as place, riches, favour,"
101158,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.85,ACHILLES,Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
101159,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.86,ACHILLES,"Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,"
101160,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.87,ACHILLES,"The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,"
101161,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.88,ACHILLES,Do one pluck down another and together
101162,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.89,ACHILLES,Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
101163,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.90,ACHILLES,Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
101164,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.91,ACHILLES,"At ample point all that I did possess,"
101165,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.92,ACHILLES,"Save these men's looks, who do, methinks, find out"
101166,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.93,ACHILLES,Something not worth in me such rich beholding
101167,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.94,ACHILLES,"As they have often given. Here is Ulysses,"
101168,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.95,ACHILLES,I'll interrupt his reading.
101169,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.96,ACHILLES,How now Ulysses!
101170,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.3.97,ULYSSES,"Now, great Thetis' son!"
101171,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,3.3.98,ACHILLES,What are you reading?
101172,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.99,ULYSSES,A strange fellow here
101173,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.100,ULYSSES,"Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,"
101174,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.101,ULYSSES,"How much in having, or without or in,"
101175,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.102,ULYSSES,"Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,"
101176,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.103,ULYSSES,"Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection,"
101177,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.104,ULYSSES,As when his virtues shining upon others
101178,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.105,ULYSSES,Heat them and they retort that heat again
101179,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.106,ULYSSES,To the first giver.'
101180,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.107,ACHILLES,"This is not strange, Ulysses."
101181,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.108,ACHILLES,The beauty that is borne here in the face
101182,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.109,ACHILLES,"The bearer knows not, but commends itself"
101183,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.110,ACHILLES,"To others' eyes, nor doth the eye itself,"
101184,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.111,ACHILLES,"That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,"
101185,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.112,ACHILLES,"Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed"
101186,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.113,ACHILLES,"Salutes each other with each other's form,"
101187,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.114,ACHILLES,"For speculation turns not to itself,"
101188,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.115,ACHILLES,Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
101189,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.116,ACHILLES,Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
101190,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.117,ULYSSES,"I do not strain at the position,--"
101191,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.118,ULYSSES,"It is familiar,--but at the author's drift,"
101192,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.119,ULYSSES,"Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves"
101193,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.120,ULYSSES,"That no man is the lord of any thing,"
101194,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.121,ULYSSES,"Though in and of him there be much consisting,"
101195,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.122,ULYSSES,Till he communicate his parts to others:
101196,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.123,ULYSSES,Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
101197,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.124,ULYSSES,Till he behold them form'd in the applause
101198,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.125,ULYSSES,"Where they're extended, who, like an arch,"
101199,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.126,ULYSSES,reverberates
101200,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.127,ULYSSES,"The voice again, or, like a gate of steel"
101201,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.128,ULYSSES,"Fronting the sun, receives and renders back"
101202,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.129,ULYSSES,"His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this,"
101203,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.130,ULYSSES,And apprehended here immediately
101204,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.131,ULYSSES,The unknown Ajax.
101205,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.132,ULYSSES,"Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,"
101206,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.133,ULYSSES,"That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are"
101207,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.134,ULYSSES,Most abject in regard and dear in use!
101208,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.135,ULYSSES,What things again most dear in the esteem
101209,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.136,ULYSSES,And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
101210,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.137,ULYSSES,An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
101211,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.138,ULYSSES,"Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,"
101212,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.139,ULYSSES,While some men leave to do!
101213,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.140,ULYSSES,"How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,"
101214,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.141,ULYSSES,Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
101215,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.142,ULYSSES,"How one man eats into another's pride,"
101216,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.143,ULYSSES,While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
101217,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.144,ULYSSES,"To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already"
101218,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.145,ULYSSES,"They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,"
101219,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.146,ULYSSES,As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
101220,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.147,ULYSSES,And great Troy shrieking.
101221,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,3.3.148,ACHILLES,"I do believe it, for they pass'd by me"
101222,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,3.3.149,ACHILLES,"As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me"
101223,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,3.3.150,ACHILLES,"Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?"
101224,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.151,ULYSSES,"Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,"
101225,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.152,ULYSSES,"Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,"
101226,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.153,ULYSSES,A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
101227,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.154,ULYSSES,"Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour'd"
101228,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.155,ULYSSES,"As fast as they are made, forgot as soon"
101229,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.156,ULYSSES,"As done: perseverance, dear my lord,"
101230,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.157,ULYSSES,Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
101231,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.158,ULYSSES,"Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail"
101232,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.159,ULYSSES,"In monumental mockery. Take the instant way,"
101233,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.160,ULYSSES,"For honour travels in a strait so narrow,"
101234,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.161,ULYSSES,"Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path,"
101235,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.162,ULYSSES,For emulation hath a thousand sons
101236,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.163,ULYSSES,"That one by one pursue: if you give way,"
101237,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.164,ULYSSES,"Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,"
101238,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.165,ULYSSES,"Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by"
101239,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.166,ULYSSES,"And leave you hindmost,"
101240,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.167,ULYSSES,"Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,"
101241,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.168,ULYSSES,"Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,"
101242,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.169,ULYSSES,"O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,"
101243,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.170,ULYSSES,"Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours,"
101244,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.171,ULYSSES,For time is like a fashionable host
101245,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.172,ULYSSES,"That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,"
101246,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.173,ULYSSES,"And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,"
101247,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.174,ULYSSES,"Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,"
101248,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.175,ULYSSES,"And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not"
101249,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.176,ULYSSES,virtue seek
101250,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.177,ULYSSES,"Remuneration for the thing it was,"
101251,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.178,ULYSSES,"For beauty, wit,"
101252,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.179,ULYSSES,"High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,"
101253,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.180,ULYSSES,"Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all"
101254,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.181,ULYSSES,To envious and calumniating time.
101255,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.182,ULYSSES,"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,"
101256,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.183,ULYSSES,"That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,"
101257,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.184,ULYSSES,"Though they are made and moulded of things past,"
101258,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.185,ULYSSES,And give to dust that is a little gilt
101259,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.186,ULYSSES,More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
101260,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.187,ULYSSES,The present eye praises the present object.
101261,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.188,ULYSSES,"Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,"
101262,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.189,ULYSSES,"That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,"
101263,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.190,ULYSSES,Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
101264,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.191,ULYSSES,"Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,"
101265,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.192,ULYSSES,"And still it might, and yet it may again,"
101266,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.193,ULYSSES,If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
101267,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.194,ULYSSES,"And case thy reputation in thy tent,"
101268,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.195,ULYSSES,"Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,"
101269,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.196,ULYSSES,Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
101270,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.197,ULYSSES,And drave great Mars to faction.
101271,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,3.3.198,ACHILLES,Of this my privacy
101272,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,3.3.199,ACHILLES,I have strong reasons.
101273,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.3.200,ULYSSES,But 'gainst your privacy
101274,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.3.201,ULYSSES,The reasons are more potent and heroical:
101275,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.3.202,ULYSSES,"'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love"
101276,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.3.203,ULYSSES,With one of Priam's daughters.
101277,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.3.204,ACHILLES,Ha! known!
101278,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.205,ULYSSES,Is that a wonder?
101279,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.206,ULYSSES,The providence that's in a watchful state
101280,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.207,ULYSSES,"Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,"
101281,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.208,ULYSSES,"Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,"
101282,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.209,ULYSSES,"Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,"
101283,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.210,ULYSSES,Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
101284,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.211,ULYSSES,There is a mystery--with whom relation
101285,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.212,ULYSSES,"Durst never meddle--in the soul of state,"
101286,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.213,ULYSSES,Which hath an operation more divine
101287,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.214,ULYSSES,Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
101288,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.215,ULYSSES,All the commerce that you have had with Troy
101289,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.216,ULYSSES,"As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord,"
101290,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.217,ULYSSES,And better would it fit Achilles much
101291,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.218,ULYSSES,To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
101292,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.219,ULYSSES,"But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,"
101293,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.220,ULYSSES,"When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,"
101294,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.221,ULYSSES,"And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,"
101295,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.222,ULYSSES,"'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,"
101296,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.223,ULYSSES,But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
101297,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.224,ULYSSES,"Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak,"
101298,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.225,ULYSSES,The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
101299,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,,ULYSSES,Exit
101300,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.226,PATROCLUS,"To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:"
101301,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.227,PATROCLUS,A woman impudent and mannish grown
101302,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.228,PATROCLUS,Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
101303,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.229,PATROCLUS,"In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this,"
101304,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.230,PATROCLUS,They think my little stomach to the war
101305,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.231,PATROCLUS,And your great love to me restrains you thus:
101306,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.232,PATROCLUS,"Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid"
101307,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.233,PATROCLUS,"Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,"
101308,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.234,PATROCLUS,"And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,"
101309,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.235,PATROCLUS,Be shook to air.
101310,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,3.3.236,ACHILLES,Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
101311,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,3.3.237,PATROCLUS,"Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him."
101312,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,3.3.238,ACHILLES,I see my reputation is at stake
101313,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,3.3.239,ACHILLES,My fame is shrewdly gored.
101314,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.240,PATROCLUS,"O, then, beware,"
101315,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.241,PATROCLUS,Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
101316,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.242,PATROCLUS,Omission to do what is necessary
101317,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.243,PATROCLUS,"Seals a commission to a blank of danger,"
101318,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.244,PATROCLUS,"And danger, like an ague, subtly taints"
101319,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.245,PATROCLUS,Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
101320,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.246,ACHILLES,"Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:"
101321,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.247,ACHILLES,I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
101322,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.248,ACHILLES,To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
101323,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.249,ACHILLES,"To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,"
101324,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.250,ACHILLES,"An appetite that I am sick withal,"
101325,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.251,ACHILLES,"To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,"
101326,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.252,ACHILLES,"To talk with him and to behold his visage,"
101327,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.253,ACHILLES,Even to my full of view.
101328,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,,ACHILLES,Enter THERSITES
101329,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.254,ACHILLES,A labour saved!
101330,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,3.3.255,THERSITES,A wonder!
101331,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,3.3.256,ACHILLES,What?
101332,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.3.257,THERSITES,"Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself."
101333,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,3.3.258,ACHILLES,How so?
101334,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.3.259,THERSITES,"He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so"
101335,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.3.260,THERSITES,prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
101336,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.3.261,THERSITES,raves in saying nothing.
101337,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.3.262,ACHILLES,How can that be?
101338,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.263,THERSITES,"Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride"
101339,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.264,THERSITES,and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
101340,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.265,THERSITES,arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
101341,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.266,THERSITES,"bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should"
101342,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.267,THERSITES,"say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out,'"
101343,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.268,THERSITES,"and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire"
101344,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.269,THERSITES,"in a flint, which will not show without knocking."
101345,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.270,THERSITES,"The man's undone forever, for if Hector break not his"
101346,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.271,THERSITES,"neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in"
101347,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.272,THERSITES,"vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,"
101348,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.273,THERSITES,"Ajax,' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think"
101349,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.274,THERSITES,you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
101350,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.275,THERSITES,"grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster."
101351,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.276,THERSITES,A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
101352,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.277,THERSITES,"sides, like a leather jerkin."
101353,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.3.278,ACHILLES,"Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites."
101354,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.3.279,THERSITES,"Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody, he professes not"
101355,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.3.280,THERSITES,"answering: speaking is for beggars, he wears his"
101356,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.3.281,THERSITES,tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
101357,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.3.282,THERSITES,"Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the"
101358,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.3.283,THERSITES,pageant of Ajax.
101359,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.3.284,ACHILLES,"To him, Patroclus, tell him I humbly desire the"
101360,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.3.285,ACHILLES,valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
101361,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.3.286,ACHILLES,"to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure"
101362,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.3.287,ACHILLES,safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
101363,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.3.288,ACHILLES,and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
101364,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.3.289,ACHILLES,"captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,"
101365,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.3.290,ACHILLES,et cetera. Do this.
101366,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,3.3.291,PATROCLUS,Jove bless great Ajax!
101367,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,3.3.292,THERSITES,Hum!
101368,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,3.3.293,PATROCLUS,"I come from the worthy Achilles,--"
101369,Troilus and Cressida,55.0,3.3.294,THERSITES,Ha!
101370,Troilus and Cressida,56.0,3.3.295,PATROCLUS,"Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--"
101371,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,3.3.296,THERSITES,Hum!
101372,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,3.3.297,PATROCLUS,And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
101373,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,3.3.298,THERSITES,Agamemnon!
101374,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,3.3.299,PATROCLUS,"Ay, my lord."
101375,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,3.3.300,THERSITES,Ha!
101376,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,3.3.301,PATROCLUS,What say you to't?
101377,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,3.3.302,THERSITES,"God b' wi' you, with all my heart."
101378,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,3.3.303,PATROCLUS,"Your answer, sir."
101379,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,3.3.304,THERSITES,"If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will"
101380,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,3.3.305,THERSITES,"go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me"
101381,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,3.3.306,THERSITES,ere he has me.
101382,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,3.3.307,PATROCLUS,"Your answer, sir."
101383,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,3.3.308,THERSITES,"Fare you well, with all my heart."
101384,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,3.3.309,ACHILLES,"Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?"
101385,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,3.3.310,THERSITES,"No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in"
101386,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,3.3.311,THERSITES,"him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know"
101387,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,3.3.312,THERSITES,"not, but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo"
101388,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,3.3.313,THERSITES,get his sinews to make catlings on.
101389,Troilus and Cressida,70.0,3.3.314,ACHILLES,"Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight."
101390,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,3.3.315,THERSITES,"Let me bear another to his horse, for that's the more"
101391,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,3.3.316,THERSITES,capable creature.
101392,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,3.3.317,ACHILLES,"My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd,"
101393,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,3.3.318,ACHILLES,And I myself see not the bottom of it.
101394,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,,ACHILLES,Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
101395,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,3.3.319,THERSITES,"Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,"
101396,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,3.3.320,THERSITES,that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
101397,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,3.3.321,THERSITES,tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.
101398,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,,THERSITES,Exit
101399,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,,THERSITES,ACT IV
101400,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,,THERSITES,SCENE I. Troy. A street.
101401,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,,THERSITES,"Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a  torch, from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, DIOMEDES, and others, with torches"
101402,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,4.1.1,PARIS,"See, ho! who is that there?"
101403,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.1.2,DEIPHOBUS,It is the Lord AEneas.
101404,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.1.3,AENEAS,Is the prince there in person?
101405,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.1.4,AENEAS,Had I so good occasion to lie long
101406,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.1.5,AENEAS,"As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business"
101407,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.1.6,AENEAS,Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
101408,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,4.1.7,DIOMEDES,"That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas."
101409,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.1.8,PARIS,"A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--"
101410,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.1.9,PARIS,"Witness the process of your speech, wherein"
101411,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.1.10,PARIS,"You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,"
101412,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.1.11,PARIS,Did haunt you in the field.
101413,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.1.12,AENEAS,"Health to you, valiant sir,"
101414,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.1.13,AENEAS,"During all question of the gentle truce,"
101415,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.1.14,AENEAS,"But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance"

101441,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.40,PARIS,"For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:"

101443,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.42,PARIS,Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
101444,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.43,PARIS,"Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--"
101445,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.44,PARIS,My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
101446,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.45,PARIS,Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
101447,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.46,PARIS,With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
101448,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.47,PARIS,We shall be much unwelcome.
101449,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.1.48,AENEAS,That I assure you:
101450,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.1.49,AENEAS,Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
101451,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.1.50,AENEAS,Than Cressid borne from Troy.

101456,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,,AENEAS,Exit with Servant
101457,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.1.55,PARIS,"And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,"
101458,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.1.56,PARIS,"Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,"
101459,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.1.57,PARIS,"Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,"
101460,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.1.58,PARIS,Myself or Menelaus?
101461,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.59,DIOMEDES,Both alike:
101462,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.60,DIOMEDES,"He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,"
101463,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.61,DIOMEDES,"Not making any scruple of her soilure,"
101464,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.62,DIOMEDES,"With such a hell of pain and world of charge,"
101465,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.63,DIOMEDES,"And you as well to keep her, that defend her,"
101466,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.64,DIOMEDES,"Not palating the taste of her dishonour,"
101467,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.65,DIOMEDES,With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
101468,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.66,DIOMEDES,"He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up"
101469,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.67,DIOMEDES,"The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece,"
101470,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.68,DIOMEDES,"You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins"
101471,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.69,DIOMEDES,Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
101472,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.70,DIOMEDES,"Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more,"
101473,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.71,DIOMEDES,"But he as he, the heavier for a whore."
101474,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,4.1.72,PARIS,You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
101475,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.73,DIOMEDES,"She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:"
101476,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.74,DIOMEDES,For every false drop in her bawdy veins
101477,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.75,DIOMEDES,"A Grecian's life hath sunk, for every scruple"
101478,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.76,DIOMEDES,"Of her contaminated carrion weight,"
101479,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.77,DIOMEDES,"A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,"
101480,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.78,DIOMEDES,She hath not given so many good words breath
101481,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.79,DIOMEDES,As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
101482,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.1.80,PARIS,"Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,"
101483,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.1.81,PARIS,Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
101484,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.1.82,PARIS,"But we in silence hold this virtue well,"
101485,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.1.83,PARIS,We'll but commend what we intend to sell.

101495,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.2.6,TROILUS,And give as soft attachment to thy senses
101496,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.2.7,TROILUS,As infants' empty of all thought!
101497,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,4.2.8,CRESSIDA,"Good morrow, then."
101498,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.2.9,TROILUS,"I prithee now, to bed."

101500,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.2.11,TROILUS,"O Cressida! but that the busy day,"
101501,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.2.12,TROILUS,"Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,"
101502,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.2.13,TROILUS,"And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,"

101506,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.2.17,TROILUS,"As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love"
101507,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.2.18,TROILUS,With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
101508,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.2.19,TROILUS,"You will catch cold, and curse me."

101512,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,4.2.23,CRESSIDA,And then you would have tarried. Hark!

101514,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,4.2.25,PANDARUS,"[Within]  What, 's all the doors open here?"
101515,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,4.2.26,TROILUS,It is your uncle.
101516,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,4.2.27,CRESSIDA,A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:

101634,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.4.3,CRESSIDA,"The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,"
101635,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.4.4,CRESSIDA,And violenteth in a sense as strong
101636,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.4.5,CRESSIDA,As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?

101659,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.4.26,TROILUS,More bright in zeal than the devotion which
101660,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.4.27,TROILUS,"Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me."

101673,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.40,TROILUS,Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
101674,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.41,TROILUS,"We two, that with so many thousand sighs"
101675,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.42,TROILUS,"Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves"

101682,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.49,TROILUS,"And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,"
101683,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.50,TROILUS,Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
101684,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.4.51,AENEAS,"[Within]  My lord, is the lady ready?"
101685,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.4.52,TROILUS,Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
101686,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.4.53,TROILUS,Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
101687,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.4.54,TROILUS,"Bid them have patience, she shall come anon."
101688,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,4.4.55,PANDARUS,"Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or"

101697,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.63,TROILUS,"Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,"
101698,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.64,TROILUS,For it is parting from us:
101699,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.65,TROILUS,"I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,"
101700,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.66,TROILUS,"For I will throw my glove to Death himself,"
101701,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.67,TROILUS,That there's no maculation in thy heart:
101702,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.68,TROILUS,"But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in"
101703,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.69,TROILUS,"My sequent protestation, be thou true,"
101704,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.70,TROILUS,And I will see thee.
101705,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,4.4.71,CRESSIDA,"O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers"
101706,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,4.4.72,CRESSIDA,As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.
101707,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,4.4.73,TROILUS,And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
101708,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,4.4.74,CRESSIDA,And you this glove. When shall I see you?
101709,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.4.75,TROILUS,"I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,"
101710,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.4.76,TROILUS,To give thee nightly visitation.
101711,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.4.77,TROILUS,But yet be true.
101712,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,4.4.78,CRESSIDA,O heavens! 'be true' again!
101713,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.79,TROILUS,"Hear while I speak it, love:"
101714,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.80,TROILUS,"The Grecian youths are full of quality,"
101715,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.81,TROILUS,"They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,"
101716,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.82,TROILUS,Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:
101717,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.83,TROILUS,"How novelty may move, and parts with person,"
101718,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.84,TROILUS,"Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--"
101719,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.85,TROILUS,"Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--"
101720,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.86,TROILUS,Makes me afeard.
101721,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,4.4.87,CRESSIDA,O heavens! you love me not.
101722,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.88,TROILUS,"Die I a villain, then!"
101723,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.89,TROILUS,In this I do not call your faith in question
101724,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.90,TROILUS,"So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,"
101725,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.91,TROILUS,"Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,"
101726,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.92,TROILUS,"Nor play at subtle games, fair virtues all,"
101727,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.93,TROILUS,To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
101728,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.94,TROILUS,But I can tell that in each grace of these
101729,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.95,TROILUS,There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
101730,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.96,TROILUS,That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
101731,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,4.4.97,CRESSIDA,Do you think I will?
101732,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.98,TROILUS,No.
101733,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.99,TROILUS,But something may be done that we will not:
101734,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.100,TROILUS,"And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,"
101735,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.101,TROILUS,"When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,"
101736,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.102,TROILUS,Presuming on their changeful potency.
101737,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,4.4.103,AENEAS,"[Within]  Nay, good my lord,--"
101738,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,4.4.104,TROILUS,"Come, kiss, and let us part."

101742,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,4.4.108,CRESSIDA,"My lord, will you be true?"
101743,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.109,TROILUS,"Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:"
101744,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.110,TROILUS,"Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,"
101745,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.111,TROILUS,"I with great truth catch mere simplicity,"
101746,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.112,TROILUS,"Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,"
101747,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.113,TROILUS,With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
101748,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.114,TROILUS,Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
101749,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.115,TROILUS,"Is 'plain and true,' there's all the reach of it."
101750,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,,TROILUS,"Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS, and DIOMEDES"
101751,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.116,TROILUS,"Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady"
101752,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.117,TROILUS,Which for Antenor we deliver you:
101753,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.118,TROILUS,"At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,"
101754,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.119,TROILUS,And by the way possess thee what she is.
101755,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.120,TROILUS,"Entreat her fair, and, by my soul, fair Greek,"
101756,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.121,TROILUS,"If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,"
101757,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.122,TROILUS,Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
101758,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.123,TROILUS,As Priam is in Ilion.
101759,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,4.4.124,DIOMEDES,"Fair Lady Cressid,"
101760,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,4.4.125,DIOMEDES,"So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:"

101764,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.129,TROILUS,"Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,"
101765,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.130,TROILUS,To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
101766,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.131,TROILUS,"In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,"
101767,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.132,TROILUS,She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
101768,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.133,TROILUS,As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
101769,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.134,TROILUS,"I charge thee use her well, even for my charge,"
101770,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.135,TROILUS,"For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,"
101771,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.136,TROILUS,"Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,"
101772,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.137,TROILUS,I'll cut thy throat.

101776,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.141,DIOMEDES,"I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,"
101777,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.142,DIOMEDES,I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
101778,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.143,DIOMEDES,"She shall be prized, but that you say 'be't so,'"
101779,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.144,DIOMEDES,"I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'"
101780,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.4.145,TROILUS,"Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,"
101781,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.4.146,TROILUS,This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
101782,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.4.147,TROILUS,"Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,"
101783,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.4.148,TROILUS,To our own selves bend we our needful talk.

101790,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,4.4.153,PARIS,"'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him."

101811,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,,AJAX,Trumpet sounds
101812,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.5.13,ULYSSES,No trumpet answers.
101813,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,4.5.14,ACHILLES,'Tis but early days.
101814,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.5.15,AGAMEMNON,"Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?"
101815,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.5.16,ULYSSES,"'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait,"
101816,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.5.17,ULYSSES,He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
101817,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.5.18,ULYSSES,In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
101818,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,,ULYSSES,"Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA"
101819,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.5.19,AGAMEMNON,Is this the Lady Cressid?
101820,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,4.5.20,DIOMEDES,Even she.
101821,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.5.21,AGAMEMNON,"Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady."
101822,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,4.5.22,NESTOR,Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
101823,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,4.5.23,ULYSSES,"Yet is the kindness but particular,"
101824,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,4.5.24,ULYSSES,'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
101825,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,4.5.25,NESTOR,And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
101826,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,4.5.26,NESTOR,So much for Nestor.
101827,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,4.5.27,ACHILLES,"I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:"
101828,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,4.5.28,ACHILLES,Achilles bids you welcome.
101829,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.5.29,MENELAUS,I had good argument for kissing once.
101830,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.5.30,PATROCLUS,"But that's no argument for kissing now,"
101831,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.5.31,PATROCLUS,"For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,"
101832,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.5.32,PATROCLUS,And parted thus you and your argument.
101833,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.5.33,ULYSSES,"O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!"
101834,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.5.34,ULYSSES,For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
101835,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,4.5.35,PATROCLUS,"The first was Menelaus' kiss, this, mine:"
101836,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,4.5.36,PATROCLUS,Patroclus kisses you.
101837,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.5.37,MENELAUS,"O, this is trim!"
101838,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.5.38,PATROCLUS,Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
101839,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,4.5.39,MENELAUS,"I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave."
101840,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.5.40,CRESSIDA,"In kissing, do you render or receive?"
101841,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.5.41,PATROCLUS,Both take and give.
101842,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.5.42,CRESSIDA,"I'll make my match to live,"
101843,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.5.43,CRESSIDA,"The kiss you take is better than you give,"
101844,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.5.44,CRESSIDA,Therefore no kiss.
101845,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,4.5.45,MENELAUS,"I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one."
101846,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,4.5.46,CRESSIDA,"You're an odd man, give even or give none."
101847,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,4.5.47,MENELAUS,"An odd man, lady! every man is odd."
101848,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.5.48,CRESSIDA,"No, Paris is not, for you know 'tis true,"
101849,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.5.49,CRESSIDA,"That you are odd, and he is even with you."
101850,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,4.5.50,MENELAUS,You fillip me o' the head.
101851,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.5.51,CRESSIDA,"No, I'll be sworn."
101852,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,4.5.52,ULYSSES,"It were no match, your nail against his horn."
101853,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,4.5.53,ULYSSES,"May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?"
101854,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.5.54,CRESSIDA,You may.
101855,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,4.5.55,ULYSSES,I do desire it.
101856,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.5.56,CRESSIDA,"Why, beg, then."
101857,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,4.5.57,ULYSSES,"Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,"
101858,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,4.5.58,ULYSSES,"When Helen is a maid again, and his."
101859,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,4.5.59,CRESSIDA,"I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due."
101860,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,4.5.60,ULYSSES,"Never's my day, and then a kiss of you."
101861,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,4.5.61,DIOMEDES,"Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father."
101862,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,,DIOMEDES,Exit with CRESSIDA
101863,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,4.5.62,NESTOR,A woman of quick sense.
101864,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.63,ULYSSES,"Fie, fie upon her!"
101865,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.64,ULYSSES,"There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,"
101866,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.65,ULYSSES,"Nay, her foot speaks, her wanton spirits look out"
101867,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.66,ULYSSES,At every joint and motive of her body.
101868,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.67,ULYSSES,"O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,"
101869,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.68,ULYSSES,"That give accosting welcome ere it comes,"
101870,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.69,ULYSSES,And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
101871,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.70,ULYSSES,To every ticklish reader! set them down
101872,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.71,ULYSSES,For sluttish spoils of opportunity
101873,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.72,ULYSSES,And daughters of the game.
101874,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,,ULYSSES,Trumpet within
101875,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,4.5.73,ALL,The Trojans' trumpet.
101876,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.5.74,AGAMEMNON,Yonder comes the troop.
101877,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.5.74,AGAMEMNON,"Enter HECTOR, armed, AENEAS, TROILUS, and other Trojans, with Attendants"
101878,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.75,AENEAS,"Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done"
101879,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.76,AENEAS,To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
101880,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.77,AENEAS,A victor shall be known? will you the knights
101881,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.78,AENEAS,Shall to the edge of all extremity
101882,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.79,AENEAS,"Pursue each other, or shall be divided"
101883,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.80,AENEAS,By any voice or order of the field?
101884,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.81,AENEAS,Hector bade ask.
101885,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.5.82,AGAMEMNON,Which way would Hector have it?
101886,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,4.5.83,AENEAS,"He cares not, he'll obey conditions."
101887,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,4.5.84,ACHILLES,"'Tis done like Hector, but securely done,"
101888,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,4.5.85,ACHILLES,"A little proudly, and great deal misprizing"
101889,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,4.5.86,ACHILLES,The knight opposed.
101890,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,4.5.87,AENEAS,"If not Achilles, sir,"
101891,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,4.5.88,AENEAS,What is your name?
101892,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,4.5.89,ACHILLES,"If not Achilles, nothing."
101893,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.90,AENEAS,"Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:"
101894,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.91,AENEAS,"In the extremity of great and little,"
101895,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.92,AENEAS,"Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector,"
101896,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.93,AENEAS,"The one almost as infinite as all,"
101897,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.94,AENEAS,"The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,"
101898,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.95,AENEAS,And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
101899,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.96,AENEAS,This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
101900,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.97,AENEAS,"In love whereof, half Hector stays at home,"
101901,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.98,AENEAS,"Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek"
101902,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.99,AENEAS,"This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek."
101903,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,4.5.100,ACHILLES,"A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you."
101904,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,,ACHILLES,Re-enter DIOMEDES
101905,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.101,AGAMEMNON,"Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,"
101906,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.102,AGAMEMNON,Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
101907,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.103,AGAMEMNON,"Consent upon the order of their fight,"
101908,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.104,AGAMEMNON,"So be it, either to the uttermost,"
101909,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.105,AGAMEMNON,Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
101910,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.106,AGAMEMNON,Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
101911,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,,AGAMEMNON,AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists
101912,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,4.5.107,ULYSSES,They are opposed already.
101913,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,4.5.108,AGAMEMNON,What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
101914,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.109,ULYSSES,"The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,"
101915,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.110,ULYSSES,"Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,"
101916,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.111,ULYSSES,"Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue,"
101917,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.112,ULYSSES,Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
101918,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.113,ULYSSES,"His heart and hand both open and both free,"
101919,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.114,ULYSSES,"For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,"
101920,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.115,ULYSSES,"Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,"
101921,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.116,ULYSSES,"Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath,"
101922,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.117,ULYSSES,"Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,"
101923,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.118,ULYSSES,For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
101924,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.119,ULYSSES,"To tender objects, but he in heat of action"
101925,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.120,ULYSSES,Is more vindicative than jealous love:
101926,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.121,ULYSSES,"They call him Troilus, and on him erect"
101927,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.122,ULYSSES,"A second hope, as fairly built as Hector."
101928,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.123,ULYSSES,"Thus says AEneas, one that knows the youth"
101929,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.124,ULYSSES,"Even to his inches, and with private soul"
101930,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.125,ULYSSES,Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
101931,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,,ULYSSES,Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight
101932,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,4.5.126,AGAMEMNON,They are in action.
101933,Troilus and Cressida,55.0,4.5.127,NESTOR,"Now, Ajax, hold thine own!"
101934,Troilus and Cressida,56.0,4.5.128,TROILUS,"Hector, thou sleep'st,"
101935,Troilus and Cressida,56.0,4.5.129,TROILUS,Awake thee!
101936,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,4.5.130,AGAMEMNON,"His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!"
101937,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,4.5.131,DIOMEDES,You must no more.
101938,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,,DIOMEDES,Trumpets cease
101939,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,4.5.132,AENEAS,"Princes, enough, so please you."
101940,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,4.5.133,AJAX,"I am not warm yet, let us fight again."
101941,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,4.5.134,DIOMEDES,As Hector pleases.
101942,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.135,HECTOR,"Why, then will I no more:"
101943,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.136,HECTOR,"Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,"
101944,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.137,HECTOR,"A cousin-german to great Priam's seed,"
101945,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.138,HECTOR,The obligation of our blood forbids
101946,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.139,HECTOR,A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
101947,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.140,HECTOR,Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
101948,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.141,HECTOR,"That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,"
101949,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.142,HECTOR,"And this is Trojan, the sinews of this leg"
101950,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.143,HECTOR,"All Greek, and this all Troy, my mother's blood"
101951,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.144,HECTOR,"Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister"
101952,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.145,HECTOR,"Bounds in my father's,' by Jove multipotent,"
101953,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.146,HECTOR,Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
101954,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.147,HECTOR,Wherein my sword had not impressure made
101955,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.148,HECTOR,Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
101956,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.149,HECTOR,"That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,"
101957,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.150,HECTOR,"My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword"
101958,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.151,HECTOR,"Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:"
101959,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.152,HECTOR,"By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms,"
101960,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.153,HECTOR,Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
101961,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.154,HECTOR,"Cousin, all honour to thee!"
101962,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,4.5.155,AJAX,"I thank thee, Hector"
101963,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,4.5.156,AJAX,Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
101964,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,4.5.157,AJAX,"I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence"
101965,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,4.5.158,AJAX,A great addition earned in thy death.
101966,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,4.5.159,HECTOR,"Not Neoptolemus so mirable,"
101967,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,4.5.160,HECTOR,On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
101968,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,4.5.161,HECTOR,"Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself"
101969,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,4.5.162,HECTOR,A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
101970,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,4.5.163,AENEAS,"There is expectance here from both the sides,"
101971,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,4.5.164,AENEAS,What further you will do.
101972,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,4.5.165,HECTOR,"We'll answer it,"
101973,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,4.5.166,HECTOR,"The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell."
101974,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,4.5.167,AJAX,If I might in entreaties find success--
101975,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,4.5.168,AJAX,As seld I have the chance--I would desire
101976,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,4.5.169,AJAX,My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
101977,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,4.5.170,DIOMEDES,"'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles"
101978,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,4.5.171,DIOMEDES,Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
101979,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.172,HECTOR,"AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,"
101980,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.173,HECTOR,And signify this loving interview
101981,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.174,HECTOR,"To the expecters of our Trojan part,"
101982,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.175,HECTOR,"Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin,"
101983,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.176,HECTOR,I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
101984,Troilus and Cressida,70.0,4.5.177,AJAX,Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
101985,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,4.5.178,HECTOR,"The worthiest of them tell me name by name,"
101986,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,4.5.179,HECTOR,"But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes"
101987,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,4.5.180,HECTOR,Shall find him by his large and portly size.
101988,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.181,AGAMEMNON,Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
101989,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.182,AGAMEMNON,"That would be rid of such an enemy,"
101990,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.183,AGAMEMNON,"But that's no welcome: understand more clear,"
101991,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.184,AGAMEMNON,What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
101992,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.185,AGAMEMNON,"And formless ruin of oblivion,"
101993,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.186,AGAMEMNON,"But in this extant moment, faith and troth,"
101994,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.187,AGAMEMNON,"Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,"
101995,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.188,AGAMEMNON,"Bids thee, with most divine integrity,"
101996,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.189,AGAMEMNON,"From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome."
101997,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,4.5.190,HECTOR,"I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon."
101998,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,4.5.191,AGAMEMNON,"[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy, no"
101999,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,4.5.192,AGAMEMNON,less to you.
102000,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,4.5.193,MENELAUS,Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
102001,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,4.5.194,MENELAUS,"You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither."
102002,Troilus and Cressida,76.0,4.5.195,HECTOR,Who must we answer?
102003,Troilus and Cressida,77.0,4.5.196,AENEAS,The noble Menelaus.

102006,Troilus and Cressida,78.0,4.5.199,HECTOR,Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
102007,Troilus and Cressida,78.0,4.5.200,HECTOR,"She's well, but bade me not commend her to you."
102008,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,4.5.201,MENELAUS,"Name her not now, sir, she's a deadly theme."
102009,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,4.5.202,HECTOR,"O, pardon, I offend."

102014,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.207,NESTOR,"Despising many forfeits and subduements,"
102015,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.208,NESTOR,"When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,"
102016,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.209,NESTOR,"Not letting it decline on the declined,"
102017,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.210,NESTOR,That I have said to some my standers by

102019,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.212,NESTOR,"And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,"
102020,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.213,NESTOR,"When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,"
102021,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.214,NESTOR,"Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen,"
102022,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.215,NESTOR,"But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,"
102023,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.216,NESTOR,"I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,"
102024,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.217,NESTOR,"And once fought with him: he was a soldier good,"
102025,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.218,NESTOR,"But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,"
102026,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.219,NESTOR,"Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee,"
102027,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.220,NESTOR,"And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents."

102030,Troilus and Cressida,83.0,4.5.223,HECTOR,That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
102031,Troilus and Cressida,83.0,4.5.224,HECTOR,"Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee."
102032,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,4.5.225,NESTOR,"I would my arms could match thee in contention,"
102033,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,4.5.226,NESTOR,As they contend with thee in courtesy.
102034,Troilus and Cressida,85.0,4.5.227,HECTOR,I would they could.
102035,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,4.5.228,NESTOR,Ha!
102036,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,4.5.229,NESTOR,"By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow."
102037,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,4.5.230,NESTOR,"Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time."

102039,Troilus and Cressida,87.0,4.5.232,ULYSSES,When we have here her base and pillar by us.
102040,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,4.5.233,HECTOR,"I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well."
102041,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,4.5.234,HECTOR,"Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,"
102042,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,4.5.235,HECTOR,Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
102043,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,4.5.236,HECTOR,"In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy."
102044,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,4.5.237,ULYSSES,"Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:"
102045,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,4.5.238,ULYSSES,"My prophecy is but half his journey yet,"
102046,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,4.5.239,ULYSSES,"For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,"

102048,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,4.5.241,ULYSSES,Must kiss their own feet.
102049,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,4.5.242,HECTOR,I must not believe you:
102050,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,4.5.243,HECTOR,"There they stand yet, and modestly I think,"
102051,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,4.5.244,HECTOR,The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
102052,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,4.5.245,HECTOR,"A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,"
102053,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,4.5.246,HECTOR,"And that old common arbitrator, Time,"
102054,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,4.5.247,HECTOR,Will one day end it.
102055,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,4.5.248,ULYSSES,So to him we leave it.
102056,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,4.5.249,ULYSSES,"Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:"
102057,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,4.5.250,ULYSSES,"After the general, I beseech you next"
102058,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,4.5.251,ULYSSES,To feast with me and see me at my tent.
102059,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,4.5.252,ACHILLES,"I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!"
102060,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,4.5.253,ACHILLES,"Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee,"
102061,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,4.5.254,ACHILLES,"I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,"
102062,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,4.5.255,ACHILLES,And quoted joint by joint.
102063,Troilus and Cressida,93.0,4.5.256,HECTOR,Is this Achilles?
102064,Troilus and Cressida,94.0,4.5.257,ACHILLES,I am Achilles.
102065,Troilus and Cressida,95.0,4.5.258,HECTOR,"Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee."
102066,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,4.5.259,ACHILLES,Behold thy fill.
102067,Troilus and Cressida,97.0,4.5.260,HECTOR,"Nay, I have done already."
102068,Troilus and Cressida,98.0,4.5.261,ACHILLES,"Thou art too brief: I will the second time,"
102069,Troilus and Cressida,98.0,4.5.262,ACHILLES,"As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb."
102070,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,4.5.263,HECTOR,"O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er,"
102071,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,4.5.264,HECTOR,But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
102072,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,4.5.265,HECTOR,Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
102073,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.266,ACHILLES,"Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body"
102074,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.267,ACHILLES,"Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?"
102075,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.268,ACHILLES,That I may give the local wound a name
102076,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.269,ACHILLES,And make distinct the very breach whereout
102077,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.270,ACHILLES,"Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!"
102078,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.271,HECTOR,"It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,"
102079,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.272,HECTOR,To answer such a question: stand again:
102080,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.273,HECTOR,Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
102081,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.274,HECTOR,As to prenominate in nice conjecture
102082,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.275,HECTOR,Where thou wilt hit me dead?
102083,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,4.5.276,ACHILLES,"I tell thee, yea."
102084,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.277,HECTOR,"Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,"
102085,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.278,HECTOR,"I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well,"
102086,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.279,HECTOR,"For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there,"
102087,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.280,HECTOR,"But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,"
102088,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.281,HECTOR,"I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er."
102089,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.282,HECTOR,"You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag,"
102090,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.283,HECTOR,"His insolence draws folly from my lips,"
102091,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.284,HECTOR,"But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,"
102092,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.285,HECTOR,Or may I never--
102093,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.286,AJAX,"Do not chafe thee, cousin:"
102094,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.287,AJAX,"And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,"
102095,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.288,AJAX,Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
102096,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.289,AJAX,You may have every day enough of Hector
102097,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.290,AJAX,"If you have stomach, the general state, I fear,"
102098,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.291,AJAX,Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
102099,Troilus and Cressida,105.0,4.5.292,HECTOR,"I pray you, let us see you in the field:"
102100,Troilus and Cressida,105.0,4.5.293,HECTOR,"We have had pelting wars, since you refused"
102101,Troilus and Cressida,105.0,4.5.294,HECTOR,The Grecians' cause.
102102,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,4.5.295,ACHILLES,"Dost thou entreat me, Hector?"
102103,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,4.5.296,ACHILLES,"To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death,"
102104,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,4.5.297,ACHILLES,To-night all friends.
102105,Troilus and Cressida,107.0,4.5.298,HECTOR,Thy hand upon that match.
102106,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.299,AGAMEMNON,"First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent,"
102107,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.300,AGAMEMNON,"There in the full convive we: afterwards,"
102108,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.301,AGAMEMNON,As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
102109,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.302,AGAMEMNON,"Concur together, severally entreat him."
102110,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.303,AGAMEMNON,"Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,"
102111,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.304,AGAMEMNON,That this great soldier may his welcome know.
102112,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,,AGAMEMNON,Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES

102118,Troilus and Cressida,110.0,4.5.310,ULYSSES,But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
102119,Troilus and Cressida,110.0,4.5.311,ULYSSES,On the fair Cressid.
102120,Troilus and Cressida,111.0,4.5.312,TROILUS,"Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,"

102124,Troilus and Cressida,112.0,4.5.316,ULYSSES,"As gentle tell me, of what honour was"
102125,Troilus and Cressida,112.0,4.5.317,ULYSSES,This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
102126,Troilus and Cressida,112.0,4.5.318,ULYSSES,That wails her absence?
102127,Troilus and Cressida,113.0,4.5.319,TROILUS,"O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars"
102128,Troilus and Cressida,113.0,4.5.320,TROILUS,"A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?"
102129,Troilus and Cressida,113.0,4.5.321,TROILUS,"She was beloved, she loved, she is, and doth:"

102278,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,5.2.25,THERSITES,"A juggling trick,--to be secretly open."
102279,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,5.2.26,DIOMEDES,What did you swear you would bestow on me?

102300,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,5.2.47,TROILUS,I will not speak a word!
102301,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,5.2.48,DIOMEDES,"And so, good night."
102302,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,5.2.49,CRESSIDA,"Nay, but you part in anger."
102303,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,5.2.50,TROILUS,Doth that grieve thee?
102304,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,5.2.51,TROILUS,O wither'd truth!

102310,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,5.2.57,CRESSIDA,"In faith, I do not: come hither once again."
102311,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,5.2.58,ULYSSES,"You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?"
102312,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,5.2.59,ULYSSES,You will break out.
102313,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,5.2.60,TROILUS,She strokes his cheek!
102314,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,5.2.61,ULYSSES,"Come, come."
102315,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,5.2.62,TROILUS,"Nay, stay, by Jove, I will not speak a word:"
102316,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,5.2.63,TROILUS,There is between my will and all offences
102317,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,5.2.64,TROILUS,A guard of patience: stay a little while.
102318,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,5.2.65,THERSITES,"How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and"

102320,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,5.2.67,DIOMEDES,"But will you, then?"
102321,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,5.2.68,CRESSIDA,"In faith, I will, la, never trust me else."
102322,Troilus and Cressida,55.0,5.2.69,DIOMEDES,Give me some token for the surety of it.
102323,Troilus and Cressida,56.0,5.2.70,CRESSIDA,I'll fetch you one.

102327,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,5.2.73,TROILUS,"I will not be myself, nor have cognition"
102328,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,5.2.74,TROILUS,Of what I feel: I am all patience.
102329,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,,TROILUS,Re-enter CRESSIDA

102332,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,5.2.77,TROILUS,O beauty! where is thy faith?
102333,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,5.2.78,ULYSSES,"My lord,--"
102334,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,5.2.79,TROILUS,"I will be patient, outwardly I will."
102335,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,5.2.80,CRESSIDA,"You look upon that sleeve, behold it well."
102336,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,5.2.81,CRESSIDA,He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.
102337,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,5.2.82,DIOMEDES,Whose was't?
102338,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,5.2.83,CRESSIDA,"It is no matter, now I have't again."
102339,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,5.2.84,CRESSIDA,I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
102340,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,5.2.85,CRESSIDA,"I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more."
102341,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,5.2.86,THERSITES,"Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!"
102342,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,5.2.87,DIOMEDES,I shall have it.
102343,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,5.2.88,CRESSIDA,"What, this?"
102344,Troilus and Cressida,70.0,5.2.89,DIOMEDES,"Ay, that."
102345,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.90,CRESSIDA,"O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!"
102346,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.91,CRESSIDA,Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
102347,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.92,CRESSIDA,"Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,"
102348,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.93,CRESSIDA,"And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,"
102349,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.94,CRESSIDA,"As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me,"
102350,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.95,CRESSIDA,He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
102351,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,5.2.96,DIOMEDES,"I had your heart before, this follows it."
102352,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,5.2.97,TROILUS,I did swear patience.
102353,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,5.2.98,CRESSIDA,"You shall not have it, Diomed, faith, you shall not,"
102354,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,5.2.99,CRESSIDA,I'll give you something else.
102355,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,5.2.100,DIOMEDES,I will have this: whose was it?
102356,Troilus and Cressida,76.0,5.2.101,CRESSIDA,It is no matter.
102357,Troilus and Cressida,77.0,5.2.102,DIOMEDES,"Come, tell me whose it was."
102358,Troilus and Cressida,78.0,5.2.103,CRESSIDA,'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
102359,Troilus and Cressida,78.0,5.2.104,CRESSIDA,"But, now you have it, take it."
102360,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,5.2.105,DIOMEDES,Whose was it?
102361,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,5.2.106,CRESSIDA,"By all Diana's waiting-women yond,"
102362,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,5.2.107,CRESSIDA,"And by herself, I will not tell you whose."
102363,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,5.2.108,DIOMEDES,"To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,"
102364,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,5.2.109,DIOMEDES,And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
102365,Troilus and Cressida,82.0,5.2.110,TROILUS,"Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,"
102366,Troilus and Cressida,82.0,5.2.111,TROILUS,It should be challenged.
102367,Troilus and Cressida,83.0,5.2.112,CRESSIDA,"Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not,"
102368,Troilus and Cressida,83.0,5.2.113,CRESSIDA,I will not keep my word.
102369,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,5.2.114,DIOMEDES,"Why, then, farewell,"
102370,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,5.2.115,DIOMEDES,Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
102371,Troilus and Cressida,85.0,5.2.116,CRESSIDA,"You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,"
102372,Troilus and Cressida,85.0,5.2.117,CRESSIDA,But it straight starts you.
102373,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,5.2.118,DIOMEDES,I do not like this fooling.
102374,Troilus and Cressida,87.0,5.2.119,THERSITES,"Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best."
102375,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,5.2.120,DIOMEDES,"What, shall I come? the hour?"
102376,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,5.2.121,CRESSIDA,"Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued."
102377,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,5.2.122,DIOMEDES,Farewell till then.
102378,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.123,CRESSIDA,"Good night: I prithee, come."

102380,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.124,CRESSIDA,"Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee"
102381,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.125,CRESSIDA,But with my heart the other eye doth see.
102382,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.126,CRESSIDA,"Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,"
102383,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.127,CRESSIDA,The error of our eye directs our mind:
102384,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.128,CRESSIDA,"What error leads must err, O, then conclude"
102385,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.129,CRESSIDA,Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.
102386,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,,CRESSIDA,Exit
102387,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,5.2.130,THERSITES,"A proof of strength she could not publish more,"
102388,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,5.2.131,THERSITES,Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'
102389,Troilus and Cressida,93.0,5.2.132,ULYSSES,"All's done, my lord."
102390,Troilus and Cressida,94.0,5.2.133,TROILUS,It is.
102391,Troilus and Cressida,95.0,5.2.134,ULYSSES,"Why stay we, then?"
102392,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.135,TROILUS,To make a recordation to my soul
102393,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.136,TROILUS,Of every syllable that here was spoke.
102394,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.137,TROILUS,"But if I tell how these two did co-act,"
102395,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.138,TROILUS,Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
102396,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.139,TROILUS,"Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,"
102397,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.140,TROILUS,"An esperance so obstinately strong,"
102398,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.141,TROILUS,"That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,"
102399,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.142,TROILUS,"As if those organs had deceptious functions,"
102400,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.143,TROILUS,Created only to calumniate.
102401,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.144,TROILUS,Was Cressid here?
102402,Troilus and Cressida,97.0,5.2.145,ULYSSES,"I cannot conjure, Trojan."
102403,Troilus and Cressida,98.0,5.2.146,TROILUS,"She was not, sure."
102404,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,5.2.147,ULYSSES,Most sure she was.
102405,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,5.2.148,TROILUS,"Why, my negation hath no taste of madness."
102406,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,5.2.149,ULYSSES,"Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now."
102407,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.150,TROILUS,Let it not be believed for womanhood!
102408,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.151,TROILUS,"Think, we had mothers, do not give advantage"
102409,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.152,TROILUS,"To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,"
102410,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.153,TROILUS,"For depravation, to square the general sex"
102411,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.154,TROILUS,By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.
102412,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,5.2.155,ULYSSES,"What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?"
102413,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,5.2.156,TROILUS,"Nothing at all, unless that this were she."
102414,Troilus and Cressida,105.0,5.2.157,THERSITES,Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
102415,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.158,TROILUS,"This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:"
102416,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.159,TROILUS,"If beauty have a soul, this is not she,"
102417,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.160,TROILUS,"If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,"
102418,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.161,TROILUS,"If sanctimony be the gods' delight,"
102419,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.162,TROILUS,"If there be rule in unity itself,"
102420,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.163,TROILUS,"This is not she. O madness of discourse,"
102421,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.164,TROILUS,That cause sets up with and against itself!
102422,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.165,TROILUS,Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
102423,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.166,TROILUS,"Without perdition, and loss assume all reason"
102424,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.167,TROILUS,"Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid."
102425,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.168,TROILUS,Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
102426,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.169,TROILUS,Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
102427,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.170,TROILUS,"Divides more wider than the sky and earth,"
102428,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.171,TROILUS,And yet the spacious breadth of this division
102429,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.172,TROILUS,Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
102430,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.173,TROILUS,As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
102431,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.174,TROILUS,"Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates,"
102432,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.175,TROILUS,"Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:"
102433,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.176,TROILUS,"Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself,"
102434,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.177,TROILUS,"The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed,"
102435,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.178,TROILUS,"And with another knot, five-finger-tied,"
102436,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.179,TROILUS,"The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,"
102437,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.180,TROILUS,"The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics"
102438,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.181,TROILUS,"Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed."
102439,Troilus and Cressida,107.0,5.2.182,ULYSSES,May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
102440,Troilus and Cressida,107.0,5.2.183,ULYSSES,With that which here his passion doth express?
102441,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.184,TROILUS,"Ay, Greek, and that shall be divulged well"
102442,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.185,TROILUS,In characters as red as Mars his heart
102443,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.186,TROILUS,Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
102444,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.187,TROILUS,With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
102445,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.188,TROILUS,"Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,"
102446,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.189,TROILUS,So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
102447,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.190,TROILUS,"That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm,"
102448,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.191,TROILUS,"Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,"
102449,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.192,TROILUS,My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
102450,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.193,TROILUS,"Which shipmen do the hurricano call,"
102451,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.194,TROILUS,"Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,"
102452,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.195,TROILUS,Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
102453,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.196,TROILUS,In his descent than shall my prompted sword
102454,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.197,TROILUS,Falling on Diomed.
102455,Troilus and Cressida,109.0,5.2.198,THERSITES,He'll tickle it for his concupy.
102456,Troilus and Cressida,110.0,5.2.199,TROILUS,"O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!"
102457,Troilus and Cressida,110.0,5.2.200,TROILUS,"Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,"
102458,Troilus and Cressida,110.0,5.2.201,TROILUS,And they'll seem glorious.
102459,Troilus and Cressida,111.0,5.2.202,ULYSSES,"O, contain yourself"
102460,Troilus and Cressida,111.0,5.2.203,ULYSSES,Your passion draws ears hither.
102461,Troilus and Cressida,111.0,,ULYSSES,Enter AENEAS
102462,Troilus and Cressida,112.0,5.2.204,AENEAS,"I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:"
102463,Troilus and Cressida,112.0,5.2.205,AENEAS,"Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy,"
102464,Troilus and Cressida,112.0,5.2.206,AENEAS,"Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home."
102465,Troilus and Cressida,113.0,5.2.207,TROILUS,"Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu."
102466,Troilus and Cressida,113.0,5.2.208,TROILUS,"Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,"
102467,Troilus and Cressida,113.0,5.2.209,TROILUS,"Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!"
102468,Troilus and Cressida,114.0,5.2.210,ULYSSES,I'll bring you to the gates.
102469,Troilus and Cressida,115.0,5.2.211,TROILUS,Accept distracted thanks.
102470,Troilus and Cressida,115.0,,TROILUS,"Exeunt TROILUS, AENEAS, and ULYSSES"
102471,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,5.2.212,THERSITES,Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
102472,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,5.2.213,THERSITES,"croak like a raven, I would bode, I would bode."
102473,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,5.2.214,THERSITES,Patroclus will give me any thing for the
102474,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,5.2.215,THERSITES,intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
102475,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,5.2.216,THERSITES,do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
102476,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,5.2.217,THERSITES,"Lechery, lechery, still, wars and lechery, nothing"
102477,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,5.2.218,THERSITES,else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!
102478,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,,THERSITES,Exit
102479,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,,THERSITES,SCENE III. Troy. Before Priam's palace.
102480,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,,THERSITES,Enter HECTOR and ANDROMACHE
102481,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,5.3.1,ANDROMACHE,"When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,"
102482,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,5.3.2,ANDROMACHE,To stop his ears against admonishment?
102483,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,5.3.3,ANDROMACHE,"Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day."
102484,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,5.3.4,HECTOR,"You train me to offend you, get you in:"
102485,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,5.3.5,HECTOR,"By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!"
102486,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,5.3.6,ANDROMACHE,"My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day."
102487,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,5.3.7,HECTOR,"No more, I say."
102488,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,,HECTOR,Enter CASSANDRA
102489,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,5.3.8,CASSANDRA,Where is my brother Hector?
102490,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.3.9,ANDROMACHE,"Here, sister, arm'd, and bloody in intent."
102491,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.3.10,ANDROMACHE,"Consort with me in loud and dear petition,"
102492,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.3.11,ANDROMACHE,"Pursue we him on knees, for I have dream'd"
102493,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.3.12,ANDROMACHE,"Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night"
102494,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.3.13,ANDROMACHE,Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
102495,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,5.3.14,CASSANDRA,"O, 'tis true."
102496,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,5.3.15,HECTOR,Ho! bid my trumpet sound!
102497,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.3.16,CASSANDRA,"No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother."
102498,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,5.3.17,HECTOR,"Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear."
102499,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,5.3.18,CASSANDRA,The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
102500,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,5.3.19,CASSANDRA,"They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd"
102501,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,5.3.20,CASSANDRA,Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.
102502,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,5.3.21,ANDROMACHE,"O, be persuaded! do not count it holy"
102503,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,5.3.22,ANDROMACHE,"To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,"
102504,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,5.3.23,ANDROMACHE,"For we would give much, to use violent thefts,"
102505,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,5.3.24,ANDROMACHE,And rob in the behalf of charity.
102506,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,5.3.25,CASSANDRA,"It is the purpose that makes strong the vow,"
102507,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,5.3.26,CASSANDRA,But vows to every purpose must not hold:
102508,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,5.3.27,CASSANDRA,"Unarm, sweet Hector."
102509,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,5.3.28,HECTOR,"Hold you still, I say,"
102510,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,5.3.29,HECTOR,Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:

102512,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,5.3.31,HECTOR,Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.

102514,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,5.3.32,HECTOR,"How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?"
102515,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,5.3.33,ANDROMACHE,"Cassandra, call my father to persuade."
102516,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,,ANDROMACHE,Exit CASSANDRA
102517,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,5.3.34,HECTOR,"No, faith, young Troilus, doff thy harness, youth,"
102518,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,5.3.35,HECTOR,I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
102519,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,5.3.36,HECTOR,"Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,"
102520,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,5.3.37,HECTOR,And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
102521,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,5.3.38,HECTOR,"Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,"
102522,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,5.3.39,HECTOR,I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.
102523,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,5.3.40,TROILUS,"Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,"
102524,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,5.3.41,TROILUS,Which better fits a lion than a man.
102525,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,5.3.42,HECTOR,"What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it."
102526,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,5.3.43,TROILUS,"When many times the captive Grecian falls,"
102527,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,5.3.44,TROILUS,"Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,"
102528,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,5.3.45,TROILUS,"You bid them rise, and live."
102529,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,5.3.46,HECTOR,"O,'tis fair play."
102530,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,5.3.47,TROILUS,"Fool's play, by heaven, Hector."
102531,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,5.3.48,HECTOR,How now! how now!
102532,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,5.3.49,TROILUS,"For the love of all the gods,"
102533,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,5.3.50,TROILUS,"Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,"
102534,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,5.3.51,TROILUS,"And when we have our armours buckled on,"
102535,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,5.3.52,TROILUS,"The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,"
102536,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,5.3.53,TROILUS,"Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth."
102537,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,5.3.54,HECTOR,"Fie, savage, fie!"
102538,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,5.3.55,TROILUS,"Hector, then 'tis wars."
102539,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,5.3.56,HECTOR,"Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day."
102540,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,5.3.57,TROILUS,Who should withhold me?
102541,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,5.3.58,TROILUS,"Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars"
102542,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,5.3.59,TROILUS,"Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire,"
102543,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,5.3.60,TROILUS,"Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,"
102544,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,5.3.61,TROILUS,"Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears,"
102545,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,5.3.62,TROILUS,"Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,"
102546,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,5.3.63,TROILUS,"Opposed to  hinder me, should stop my way,"
102547,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,5.3.64,TROILUS,But by my ruin.
102548,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,,TROILUS,"Re-enter CASSANDRA, with PRIAM"
102549,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,5.3.65,CASSANDRA,"Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:"

102551,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,5.3.67,CASSANDRA,"Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,"
102552,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,5.3.68,CASSANDRA,Fall all together.
102553,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,5.3.69,PRIAM,"Come, Hector, come, go back:"
102554,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,5.3.70,PRIAM,"Thy wife hath dream'd, thy mother hath had visions,"

102556,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,5.3.72,PRIAM,Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
102557,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,5.3.73,PRIAM,To tell thee that this day is ominous:
102558,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,5.3.74,PRIAM,"Therefore, come back."
102559,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,5.3.75,HECTOR,"AEneas is a-field,"
102560,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,5.3.76,HECTOR,"And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,"
102561,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,5.3.77,HECTOR,"Even in the faith of valour, to appear"
102562,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,5.3.78,HECTOR,This morning to them.
102563,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,5.3.79,PRIAM,"Ay, but thou shalt not go."
102564,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,5.3.80,HECTOR,I must not break my faith.
102565,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,5.3.81,HECTOR,"You know me dutiful, therefore, dear sir,"
102566,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,5.3.82,HECTOR,"Let me not shame respect, but give me leave"
102567,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,5.3.83,HECTOR,"To take that course by your consent and voice,"
102568,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,5.3.84,HECTOR,"Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam."
102569,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,5.3.85,CASSANDRA,"O Priam, yield not to him!"
102570,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,5.3.86,ANDROMACHE,"Do not, dear father."
102571,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,5.3.87,HECTOR,"Andromache, I am offended with you:"
102572,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,5.3.88,HECTOR,"Upon the love you bear me, get you in."

102576,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,5.3.91,CASSANDRA,"O, farewell, dear Hector!"
102577,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,5.3.92,CASSANDRA,"Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!"
102578,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,5.3.93,CASSANDRA,"Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!"
102579,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,5.3.94,CASSANDRA,"Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!"
102580,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,5.3.95,CASSANDRA,How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
102581,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,5.3.96,CASSANDRA,"Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,"
102582,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,5.3.97,CASSANDRA,"Like witless antics, one another meet,"
102583,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,5.3.98,CASSANDRA,"And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!"
102584,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,5.3.99,TROILUS,Away! away!

102885,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.41,PANDARUS,what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:

102957,Twelfth Night,3.0,1.2.5,VIOLA,"Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?"
102958,Twelfth Night,4.0,1.2.6,Captain,It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
102959,Twelfth Night,5.0,1.2.7,VIOLA,O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
102960,Twelfth Night,6.0,1.2.8,Captain,"True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,"

102972,Twelfth Night,7.0,1.2.20,VIOLA,"Whereto thy speech serves for authority,"

102981,Twelfth Night,13.0,1.2.29,VIOLA,He was a bachelor then.
102982,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.30,Captain,"And so is now, or was so very late,"
102983,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.31,Captain,"For but a month ago I went from hence,"
102984,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.32,Captain,"And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,"
102985,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.33,Captain,"What great ones do the less will prattle of,--"
102986,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.34,Captain,That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

102997,Twelfth Night,17.0,1.2.45,VIOLA,What my estate is!
102998,Twelfth Night,18.0,1.2.46,Captain,"That were hard to compass,"
102999,Twelfth Night,18.0,1.2.47,Captain,"Because she will admit no kind of suit,"
103000,Twelfth Night,18.0,1.2.48,Captain,"No, not the duke's."
103001,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.49,VIOLA,"There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,"
103002,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.50,VIOLA,And though that nature with a beauteous wall

103098,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.75,SIR ANDREW,"Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary"
103099,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.76,SIR ANDREW,put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
103100,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.77,SIR ANDREW,than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
103101,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.78,SIR ANDREW,great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
103102,Twelfth Night,44.0,1.3.79,SIR TOBY BELCH,No question.
103103,Twelfth Night,45.0,1.3.80,SIR ANDREW,"An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home"

103106,Twelfth Night,47.0,1.3.83,SIR ANDREW,What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
103107,Twelfth Night,47.0,1.3.84,SIR ANDREW,bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
103108,Twelfth Night,47.0,1.3.85,SIR ANDREW,"fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but"
103109,Twelfth Night,47.0,1.3.86,SIR ANDREW,followed the arts!
103110,Twelfth Night,48.0,1.3.87,SIR TOBY BELCH,Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
103111,Twelfth Night,49.0,1.3.88,SIR ANDREW,"Why, would that have mended my hair?"
103112,Twelfth Night,50.0,1.3.89,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature."
103113,Twelfth Night,51.0,1.3.90,SIR ANDREW,"But it becomes me well enough, does't not?"
103114,Twelfth Night,52.0,1.3.91,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I"
103115,Twelfth Night,52.0,1.3.92,SIR TOBY BELCH,hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
103116,Twelfth Night,52.0,1.3.93,SIR TOBY BELCH,and spin it off.
103117,Twelfth Night,53.0,1.3.94,SIR ANDREW,"Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece"
103118,Twelfth Night,53.0,1.3.95,SIR ANDREW,"will not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one"
103119,Twelfth Night,53.0,1.3.96,SIR ANDREW,she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
103120,Twelfth Night,54.0,1.3.97,SIR TOBY BELCH,She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above

103122,Twelfth Night,54.0,1.3.99,SIR TOBY BELCH,"have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,"

103130,Twelfth Night,57.0,1.3.107,SIR ANDREW,with an old man.
103131,Twelfth Night,58.0,1.3.108,SIR TOBY BELCH,"What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?"

103133,Twelfth Night,60.0,1.3.110,SIR TOBY BELCH,And I can cut the mutton to't.
103134,Twelfth Night,61.0,1.3.111,SIR ANDREW,And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
103135,Twelfth Night,61.0,1.3.112,SIR ANDREW,as any man in Illyria.
103136,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.113,SIR TOBY BELCH,Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
103137,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.114,SIR TOBY BELCH,these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
103138,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.115,SIR TOBY BELCH,"take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost"

103141,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.118,SIR TOBY BELCH,so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
103142,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.119,SIR TOBY BELCH,dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
103143,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.120,SIR TOBY BELCH,"I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy"

103147,Twelfth Night,64.0,1.3.124,SIR TOBY BELCH,What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
103148,Twelfth Night,65.0,1.3.125,SIR ANDREW,Taurus! That's sides and heart.

103218,Twelfth Night,9.0,1.5.15,MARIA,"to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?"
103219,Twelfth Night,10.0,1.5.16,Clown,"Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage, and,"
103220,Twelfth Night,10.0,1.5.17,Clown,"for turning away, let summer bear it out."
103221,Twelfth Night,11.0,1.5.18,MARIA,"You are resolute, then?"
103222,Twelfth Night,12.0,1.5.19,Clown,"Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points."
103223,Twelfth Night,13.0,1.5.20,MARIA,"That if one break, the other will hold, or, if both"
103224,Twelfth Night,13.0,1.5.21,MARIA,"break, your gaskins fall."
103225,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.5.22,Clown,"Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way, if"

103234,Twelfth Night,16.0,1.5.30,Clown,pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
103235,Twelfth Night,16.0,1.5.31,Clown,"'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'"
103236,Twelfth Night,16.0,,Clown,Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO

103238,Twelfth Night,17.0,1.5.33,OLIVIA,Take the fool away.
103239,Twelfth Night,18.0,1.5.34,Clown,"Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady."
103240,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.5.35,OLIVIA,"Go to, you're a dry fool, I'll no more of you:"

103246,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.5.41,Clown,"he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing"
103247,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.5.42,Clown,that's mended is but patched: virtue that
103248,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.5.43,Clown,"transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that"
103249,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.5.44,Clown,amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
103250,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.5.45,Clown,"simple syllogism will serve, so, if it will not,"
103251,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.5.46,Clown,what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
103252,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.5.47,Clown,"calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take"
103253,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.5.48,Clown,"away the fool, therefore, I say again, take her away."

103258,Twelfth Night,22.0,1.5.53,Clown,prove you a fool.
103259,Twelfth Night,23.0,1.5.54,OLIVIA,Can you do it?
103260,Twelfth Night,24.0,1.5.55,Clown,"Dexterously, good madonna."

103269,Twelfth Night,32.0,1.5.64,Clown,"The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's"
103270,Twelfth Night,32.0,1.5.65,Clown,"soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen."
103271,Twelfth Night,33.0,1.5.66,OLIVIA,"What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?"
103272,Twelfth Night,34.0,1.5.67,MALVOLIO,"Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:"

103279,Twelfth Night,36.0,1.5.74,OLIVIA,"How say you to that, Malvolio?"
103280,Twelfth Night,37.0,1.5.75,MALVOLIO,I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
103281,Twelfth Night,37.0,1.5.76,MALVOLIO,barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
103282,Twelfth Night,37.0,1.5.77,MALVOLIO,with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
103283,Twelfth Night,37.0,1.5.78,MALVOLIO,"than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard"
103284,Twelfth Night,37.0,1.5.79,MALVOLIO,"already, unless you laugh and minister occasion to"
103285,Twelfth Night,37.0,1.5.80,MALVOLIO,"him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,"

103289,Twelfth Night,38.0,1.5.84,OLIVIA,"with a distempered appetite. To be generous,"
103290,Twelfth Night,38.0,1.5.85,OLIVIA,"guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those"
103291,Twelfth Night,38.0,1.5.86,OLIVIA,things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:

104230,Twelfth Night,36.0,3.1.76,VIOLA,"My legs do better understand me, sir, than I"

104232,Twelfth Night,37.0,3.1.78,SIR TOBY BELCH,"I mean, to go, sir, to enter."
104233,Twelfth Night,38.0,3.1.79,VIOLA,I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we

104250,Twelfth Night,46.0,3.1.94,OLIVIA,Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
104251,Twelfth Night,46.0,3.1.95,OLIVIA,"You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth."
104252,Twelfth Night,47.0,3.1.96,VIOLA,"And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:"
104253,Twelfth Night,47.0,3.1.97,VIOLA,"Your servant's servant is your servant, madam."
104254,Twelfth Night,48.0,3.1.98,OLIVIA,"For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,"
104255,Twelfth Night,48.0,3.1.99,OLIVIA,"Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!"

104260,Twelfth Night,50.0,3.1.104,OLIVIA,"But, would you undertake another suit,"
104261,Twelfth Night,50.0,3.1.105,OLIVIA,I had rather hear you to solicit that
104262,Twelfth Night,50.0,3.1.106,OLIVIA,Than music from the spheres.
104263,Twelfth Night,51.0,3.1.107,VIOLA,"Dear lady,--"
104264,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.108,OLIVIA,"Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,"
104265,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.109,OLIVIA,"After the last enchantment you did here,"
104266,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.110,OLIVIA,A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
104267,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.111,OLIVIA,"Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:"
104268,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.112,OLIVIA,"Under your hard construction must I sit,"
104269,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.113,OLIVIA,"To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,"
104270,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.114,OLIVIA,Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
104271,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.115,OLIVIA,Have you not set mine honour at the stake
104272,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.116,OLIVIA,And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
104273,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.117,OLIVIA,That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
104274,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.118,OLIVIA,"Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,"
104275,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.119,OLIVIA,"Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak."
104276,Twelfth Night,53.0,3.1.120,VIOLA,I pity you.
104277,Twelfth Night,54.0,3.1.121,OLIVIA,That's a degree to love.
104278,Twelfth Night,55.0,3.1.122,VIOLA,"No, not a grize, for 'tis a vulgar proof,"
104279,Twelfth Night,55.0,3.1.123,VIOLA,That very oft we pity enemies.
104280,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.124,OLIVIA,"Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again."
104281,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.125,OLIVIA,"O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!"
104282,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.126,OLIVIA,"If one should be a prey, how much the better"
104283,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.127,OLIVIA,To fall before the lion than the wolf!
104284,Twelfth Night,56.0,,OLIVIA,Clock strikes
104285,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.128,OLIVIA,The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
104286,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.129,OLIVIA,"Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:"
104287,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.130,OLIVIA,"And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,"
104288,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.131,OLIVIA,Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
104289,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.132,OLIVIA,"There lies your way, due west."
104290,Twelfth Night,57.0,3.1.133,VIOLA,Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
104291,Twelfth Night,57.0,3.1.134,VIOLA,Attend your ladyship!
104292,Twelfth Night,57.0,3.1.135,VIOLA,"You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?"
104293,Twelfth Night,58.0,3.1.136,OLIVIA,Stay:
104294,Twelfth Night,58.0,3.1.137,OLIVIA,"I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me."
104295,Twelfth Night,59.0,3.1.138,VIOLA,That you do think you are not what you are.
104296,Twelfth Night,60.0,3.1.139,OLIVIA,"If I think so, I think the same of you."
104297,Twelfth Night,61.0,3.1.140,VIOLA,Then think you right: I am not what I am.
104298,Twelfth Night,62.0,3.1.141,OLIVIA,I would you were as I would have you be!
104299,Twelfth Night,63.0,3.1.142,VIOLA,"Would it be better, madam, than I am?"
104300,Twelfth Night,63.0,3.1.143,VIOLA,"I wish it might, for now I am your fool."
104301,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.144,OLIVIA,"O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful"
104302,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.145,OLIVIA,In the contempt and anger of his lip!
104303,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.146,OLIVIA,A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
104304,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.147,OLIVIA,Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
104305,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.148,OLIVIA,"Cesario, by the roses of the spring,"
104306,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.149,OLIVIA,"By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,"
104307,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.150,OLIVIA,"I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,"
104308,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.151,OLIVIA,Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
104309,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.152,OLIVIA,"Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,"
104310,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.153,OLIVIA,"For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,"
104311,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.154,OLIVIA,"But rather reason thus with reason fetter,"
104312,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.155,OLIVIA,"Love sought is good, but given unsought better."
104313,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.156,VIOLA,"By innocence I swear, and by my youth"
104314,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.157,VIOLA,"I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,"
104315,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.158,VIOLA,"And that no woman has, nor never none"
104316,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.159,VIOLA,"Shall mistress be of it, save I alone."
104317,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.160,VIOLA,"And so adieu, good madam: never more"
104318,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.161,VIOLA,Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
104319,Twelfth Night,66.0,3.1.162,OLIVIA,"Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move"
104320,Twelfth Night,66.0,3.1.163,OLIVIA,"That heart, which now abhors, to like his love."

104330,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.2.7,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that."
104331,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.2.8,SIR ANDREW,As plain as I see you now.
104332,Twelfth Night,7.0,3.2.9,FABIAN,This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
104333,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.2.10,SIR ANDREW,"'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?"
104334,Twelfth Night,9.0,3.2.11,FABIAN,"I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of"
104335,Twelfth Night,9.0,3.2.12,FABIAN,judgment and reason.

104350,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.2.27,SIR ANDREW,"An't be any way, it must be with valour, for policy"
104351,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.2.28,SIR ANDREW,I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a

104354,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.2.31,SIR TOBY BELCH,valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight

104429,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.3.22,SEBASTIAN,"I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:"
104430,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.3.23,SEBASTIAN,"I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes"
104431,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.3.24,SEBASTIAN,With the memorials and the things of fame
104432,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.3.25,SEBASTIAN,That do renown this city.
104433,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.3.26,ANTONIO,"Would you'ld pardon me,"
104434,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.3.27,ANTONIO,I do not without danger walk these streets:
104435,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.3.28,ANTONIO,"Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys"
104436,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.3.29,ANTONIO,"I did some service, of such note indeed,"
104437,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.3.30,ANTONIO,That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
104438,Twelfth Night,7.0,3.3.31,SEBASTIAN,Belike you slew great number of his people.
104439,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.32,ANTONIO,"The offence is not of such a bloody nature,"
104440,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.33,ANTONIO,Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
104441,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.34,ANTONIO,Might well have given us bloody argument.
104442,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.35,ANTONIO,It might have since been answer'd in repaying
104443,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.36,ANTONIO,"What we took from them, which, for traffic's sake,"
104444,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.37,ANTONIO,"Most of our city did: only myself stood out,"
104445,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.38,ANTONIO,"For which, if I be lapsed in this place,"
104446,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.39,ANTONIO,I shall pay dear.
104447,Twelfth Night,9.0,3.3.40,SEBASTIAN,Do not then walk too open.
104448,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.3.41,ANTONIO,"It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse."
104449,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.3.42,ANTONIO,"In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,"
104450,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.3.43,ANTONIO,"Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,"
104451,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.3.44,ANTONIO,Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
104452,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.3.45,ANTONIO,With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
104453,Twelfth Night,11.0,3.3.46,SEBASTIAN,Why I your purse?
104454,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.3.47,ANTONIO,Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
104455,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.3.48,ANTONIO,"You have desire to purchase, and your store,"
104456,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.3.49,ANTONIO,"I think, is not for idle markets, sir."
104457,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.3.50,SEBASTIAN,I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you
104458,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.3.51,SEBASTIAN,For an hour.
104459,Twelfth Night,14.0,3.3.52,ANTONIO,To the Elephant.

104465,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.2,OLIVIA,How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
104466,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.3,OLIVIA,For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
104467,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.4,OLIVIA,I speak too loud.
104468,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.5,OLIVIA,"Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,"
104469,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.6,OLIVIA,And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
104470,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.7,OLIVIA,Where is Malvolio?
104471,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.4.8,MARIA,"He's coming, madam, but in very strange manner. He"
104472,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.4.9,MARIA,"is, sure, possessed, madam."
104473,Twelfth Night,3.0,3.4.10,OLIVIA,"Why, what's the matter? does he rave?"
104474,Twelfth Night,4.0,3.4.11,MARIA,"No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your"
104475,Twelfth Night,4.0,3.4.12,MARIA,"ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if"
104476,Twelfth Night,4.0,3.4.13,MARIA,"he come, for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits."
104477,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.4.14,OLIVIA,Go call him hither.
104478,Twelfth Night,5.0,,OLIVIA,Exit MARIA
104479,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.4.15,OLIVIA,"I am as mad as he,"
104480,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.4.16,OLIVIA,If sad and merry madness equal be.
104481,Twelfth Night,5.0,,OLIVIA,"Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO"
104482,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.4.17,OLIVIA,"How now, Malvolio!"
104483,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.4.18,MALVOLIO,"Sweet lady, ho, ho."
104484,Twelfth Night,7.0,3.4.19,OLIVIA,Smilest thou?
104485,Twelfth Night,7.0,3.4.20,OLIVIA,I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
104486,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.21,MALVOLIO,"Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some"
104487,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.22,MALVOLIO,"obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering, but"
104488,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.23,MALVOLIO,"what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is"
104489,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.24,MALVOLIO,"with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and"
104490,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.25,MALVOLIO,please all.'
104491,Twelfth Night,9.0,3.4.26,OLIVIA,"Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?"
104492,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.4.27,MALVOLIO,"Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It"
104493,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.4.28,MALVOLIO,"did come to his hands, and commands shall be"
104494,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.4.29,MALVOLIO,executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
104495,Twelfth Night,11.0,3.4.30,OLIVIA,"Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?"
104496,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.4.31,MALVOLIO,"To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee."
104497,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.4.32,OLIVIA,God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
104498,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.4.33,OLIVIA,thy hand so oft?
104499,Twelfth Night,14.0,3.4.34,MARIA,"How do you, Malvolio?"
104500,Twelfth Night,15.0,3.4.35,MALVOLIO,"At your request! yes, nightingales answer daws."
104501,Twelfth Night,16.0,3.4.36,MARIA,Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
104502,Twelfth Night,17.0,3.4.37,MALVOLIO,'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
104503,Twelfth Night,18.0,3.4.38,OLIVIA,"What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?"
104504,Twelfth Night,19.0,3.4.39,MALVOLIO,"'Some are born great,'--"
104505,Twelfth Night,20.0,3.4.40,OLIVIA,Ha!
104506,Twelfth Night,21.0,3.4.41,MALVOLIO,"'Some achieve greatness,'--"
104507,Twelfth Night,22.0,3.4.42,OLIVIA,What sayest thou?
104508,Twelfth Night,23.0,3.4.43,MALVOLIO,'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
104509,Twelfth Night,24.0,3.4.44,OLIVIA,Heaven restore thee!
104510,Twelfth Night,25.0,3.4.45,MALVOLIO,"'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--"
104511,Twelfth Night,26.0,3.4.46,OLIVIA,Thy yellow stockings!
104512,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.4.47,MALVOLIO,'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
104513,Twelfth Night,28.0,3.4.48,OLIVIA,Cross-gartered!
104514,Twelfth Night,29.0,3.4.49,MALVOLIO,"'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so,'--"
104515,Twelfth Night,30.0,3.4.50,OLIVIA,Am I made?
104516,Twelfth Night,31.0,3.4.51,MALVOLIO,"'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'"
104517,Twelfth Night,32.0,3.4.52,OLIVIA,"Why, this is very midsummer madness."
104518,Twelfth Night,32.0,,OLIVIA,Enter Servant
104519,Twelfth Night,33.0,3.4.53,Servant,"Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is"
104520,Twelfth Night,33.0,3.4.54,Servant,returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
104521,Twelfth Night,33.0,3.4.55,Servant,attends your ladyship's pleasure.
104522,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.56,OLIVIA,I'll come to him.
104523,Twelfth Night,34.0,,OLIVIA,Exit Servant
104524,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.57,OLIVIA,"Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's"
104525,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.58,OLIVIA,my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
104526,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.59,OLIVIA,care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
104527,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.60,OLIVIA,half of my dowry.
104528,Twelfth Night,34.0,,OLIVIA,Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA

104530,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.62,MALVOLIO,Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
104531,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.63,MALVOLIO,"the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may"
104532,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.64,MALVOLIO,"appear stubborn to him, for she incites me to that"
104533,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.65,MALVOLIO,"in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she,"
104534,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.66,MALVOLIO,"'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants,"

104539,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.71,MALVOLIO,"habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have"
104540,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.72,MALVOLIO,"limed her, but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me"
104541,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.73,MALVOLIO,"thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this"
104542,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.74,MALVOLIO,"fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor"
104543,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.75,MALVOLIO,"after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing"

104546,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.78,MALVOLIO,or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
104547,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.79,MALVOLIO,that can be can come between me and the full
104548,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.80,MALVOLIO,"prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the"
104549,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.81,MALVOLIO,"doer of this, and he is to be thanked."

104562,Twelfth Night,41.0,3.4.93,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Go to, go to, peace, peace, we must deal gently"

104633,Twelfth Night,79.0,3.4.161,MARIA,You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
104634,Twelfth Night,79.0,3.4.162,MARIA,"some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart."
104635,Twelfth Night,80.0,3.4.163,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the"

104647,Twelfth Night,82.0,3.4.174,SIR TOBY BELCH,lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this

104649,Twelfth Night,82.0,3.4.176,SIR TOBY BELCH,terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a

104655,Twelfth Night,82.0,3.4.182,SIR TOBY BELCH,This will so fright them both that they will kill

104660,Twelfth Night,84.0,3.4.186,SIR TOBY BELCH,I will meditate the while upon some horrid message

104666,Twelfth Night,85.0,3.4.191,OLIVIA,"But such a headstrong potent fault it is,"
104667,Twelfth Night,85.0,3.4.192,OLIVIA,That it but mocks reproof.

104692,Twelfth Night,95.0,3.4.215,VIOLA,to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from

104699,Twelfth Night,98.0,3.4.222,SIR TOBY BELCH,"He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on"

104701,Twelfth Night,98.0,3.4.224,SIR TOBY BELCH,"brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and"
104702,Twelfth Night,98.0,3.4.225,SIR TOBY BELCH,"his incensement at this moment is so implacable,"

104705,Twelfth Night,99.0,3.4.228,VIOLA,I will return again into the house and desire some
104706,Twelfth Night,99.0,3.4.229,VIOLA,conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
104707,Twelfth Night,99.0,3.4.230,VIOLA,of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
104708,Twelfth Night,99.0,3.4.231,VIOLA,"others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man"
104709,Twelfth Night,99.0,3.4.232,VIOLA,of that quirk.

104717,Twelfth Night,101.0,3.4.240,VIOLA,"This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me"

104719,Twelfth Night,101.0,3.4.242,VIOLA,my offence to him is: it is something of my
104720,Twelfth Night,101.0,3.4.243,VIOLA,"negligence, nothing of my purpose."
104721,Twelfth Night,102.0,3.4.244,SIR TOBY BELCH,"I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this"

104726,Twelfth Night,104.0,3.4.248,FABIAN,"mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more."
104727,Twelfth Night,105.0,3.4.249,VIOLA,"I beseech you, what manner of man is he?"
104728,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.250,FABIAN,"Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by"
104729,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.251,FABIAN,"his form, as you are like to find him in the proof"
104730,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.252,FABIAN,"of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,"
104731,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.253,FABIAN,bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
104732,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.254,FABIAN,have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
104733,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.255,FABIAN,towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
104734,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.256,FABIAN,can.
104735,Twelfth Night,107.0,3.4.257,VIOLA,I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
104736,Twelfth Night,107.0,3.4.258,VIOLA,had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
104737,Twelfth Night,107.0,3.4.259,VIOLA,care not who knows so much of my mettle.

104745,Twelfth Night,108.0,3.4.265,SIR TOBY BELCH,step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
104746,Twelfth Night,109.0,3.4.266,SIR ANDREW,"Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him."
104747,Twelfth Night,110.0,3.4.267,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can"

104752,Twelfth Night,111.0,3.4.272,SIR ANDREW,"and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet."

104768,Twelfth Night,115.0,3.4.285,VIOLA,[Aside]  Pray God defend me! A little thing would

105030,Twelfth Night,42.0,4.2.84,Clown,"But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no"
105031,Twelfth Night,42.0,4.2.85,Clown,better in your wits than a fool.
105032,Twelfth Night,43.0,4.2.86,MALVOLIO,"They have here propertied me, keep me in darkness,"
105033,Twelfth Night,43.0,4.2.87,MALVOLIO,"send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to"
105034,Twelfth Night,43.0,4.2.88,MALVOLIO,face me out of my wits.
105035,Twelfth Night,44.0,4.2.89,Clown,"Advise you what you say, the minister is here."
105036,Twelfth Night,44.0,4.2.90,Clown,"Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!"
105037,Twelfth Night,44.0,4.2.91,Clown,"endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain"

105040,Twelfth Night,46.0,4.2.94,Clown,"Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,"
105041,Twelfth Night,46.0,4.2.95,Clown,"sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas."
105042,Twelfth Night,46.0,4.2.96,Clown,"Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will."
105043,Twelfth Night,47.0,4.2.97,MALVOLIO,"Fool, fool, fool, I say!"
105044,Twelfth Night,48.0,4.2.98,Clown,"Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am"
105045,Twelfth Night,48.0,4.2.99,Clown,shent for speaking to you.
105046,Twelfth Night,49.0,4.2.100,MALVOLIO,"Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I"
105047,Twelfth Night,49.0,4.2.101,MALVOLIO,"tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria."
105048,Twelfth Night,50.0,4.2.102,Clown,"Well-a-day that you were, sir"
105049,Twelfth Night,51.0,4.2.103,MALVOLIO,"By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and"
105050,Twelfth Night,51.0,4.2.104,MALVOLIO,"light, and convey what I will set down to my lady:"
105051,Twelfth Night,51.0,4.2.105,MALVOLIO,it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
105052,Twelfth Night,51.0,4.2.106,MALVOLIO,of letter did.
105053,Twelfth Night,52.0,4.2.107,Clown,"I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you"
105054,Twelfth Night,52.0,4.2.108,Clown,not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?
105055,Twelfth Night,53.0,4.2.109,MALVOLIO,"Believe me, I am not, I tell thee true."
105056,Twelfth Night,54.0,4.2.110,Clown,"Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his"
105057,Twelfth Night,54.0,4.2.111,Clown,brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.
105058,Twelfth Night,55.0,4.2.112,MALVOLIO,"Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I"
105059,Twelfth Night,55.0,4.2.113,MALVOLIO,"prithee, be gone."
105060,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.114,Clown,[Singing]
105061,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.115,Clown,"I am gone, sir,"
105062,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.116,Clown,"And anon, sir,"
105063,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.117,Clown,"I'll be with you again,"
105064,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.118,Clown,"In a trice,"
105065,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.119,Clown,"Like to the old Vice,"
105066,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.120,Clown,"Your need to sustain,"
105067,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.121,Clown,"Who, with dagger of lath,"
105068,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.122,Clown,"In his rage and his wrath,"
105069,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.123,Clown,"Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:"
105070,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.124,Clown,"Like a mad lad,"
105071,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.125,Clown,"Pare thy nails, dad,"
105072,Twelfth Night,56.0,4.2.126,Clown,"Adieu, good man devil."

105075,Twelfth Night,56.0,,Clown,Enter SEBASTIAN
105076,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.1,SEBASTIAN,"This is the air, that is the glorious sun,"
105077,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.2,SEBASTIAN,"This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't,"
105078,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.3,SEBASTIAN,"And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,"
105079,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.4,SEBASTIAN,"Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?"
105080,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.5,SEBASTIAN,I could not find him at the Elephant:
105081,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.6,SEBASTIAN,"Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,"
105082,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.7,SEBASTIAN,That he did range the town to seek me out.
105083,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.8,SEBASTIAN,"His counsel now might do me golden service,"
105084,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.9,SEBASTIAN,"For though my soul disputes well with my sense,"
105085,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.10,SEBASTIAN,"That this may be some error, but no madness,"
105086,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.11,SEBASTIAN,Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
105087,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.12,SEBASTIAN,"So far exceed all instance, all discourse,"
105088,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.13,SEBASTIAN,That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
105089,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.14,SEBASTIAN,And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
105090,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.15,SEBASTIAN,To any other trust but that I am mad
105091,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.16,SEBASTIAN,"Or else the lady's mad, yet, if 'twere so,"
105092,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.17,SEBASTIAN,"She could not sway her house, command her followers,"
105093,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.18,SEBASTIAN,Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
105094,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.19,SEBASTIAN,"With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing"
105095,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.20,SEBASTIAN,As I perceive she does: there's something in't
105096,Twelfth Night,1.0,4.3.21,SEBASTIAN,That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.
105097,Twelfth Night,1.0,,SEBASTIAN,Enter OLIVIA and Priest
105098,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.22,OLIVIA,"Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,"
105099,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.23,OLIVIA,Now go with me and with this holy man
105100,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.24,OLIVIA,"Into the chantry by: there, before him,"
105101,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.25,OLIVIA,"And underneath that consecrated roof,"
105102,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.26,OLIVIA,"Plight me the full assurance of your faith,"
105103,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.27,OLIVIA,That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
105104,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.28,OLIVIA,May live at peace. He shall conceal it
105105,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.29,OLIVIA,"Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,"
105106,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.30,OLIVIA,What time we will our celebration keep
105107,Twelfth Night,2.0,4.3.31,OLIVIA,According to my birth. What do you say?
105108,Twelfth Night,3.0,4.3.32,SEBASTIAN,"I'll follow this good man, and go with you,"
105109,Twelfth Night,3.0,4.3.33,SEBASTIAN,"And, having sworn truth, ever will be true."
105110,Twelfth Night,4.0,4.3.34,OLIVIA,"Then lead the way, good father, and heavens so shine,"
105111,Twelfth Night,4.0,4.3.35,OLIVIA,That they may fairly note this act of mine!
105112,Twelfth Night,4.0,,OLIVIA,Exeunt

105115,Twelfth Night,4.0,,OLIVIA,Enter Clown and FABIAN
105116,Twelfth Night,1.0,5.1.1,FABIAN,"Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter."
105117,Twelfth Night,2.0,5.1.2,Clown,"Good Master Fabian, grant me another request."
105118,Twelfth Night,3.0,5.1.3,FABIAN,Any thing.
105119,Twelfth Night,4.0,5.1.4,Clown,Do not desire to see this letter.
105120,Twelfth Night,5.0,5.1.5,FABIAN,"This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my"
105121,Twelfth Night,5.0,5.1.6,FABIAN,dog again.
105122,Twelfth Night,5.0,,FABIAN,"Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords"
105123,Twelfth Night,6.0,5.1.7,DUKE ORSINO,"Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?"
105124,Twelfth Night,7.0,5.1.8,Clown,"Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings."
105125,Twelfth Night,8.0,5.1.9,DUKE ORSINO,"I know thee well, how dost thou, my good fellow?"
105126,Twelfth Night,9.0,5.1.10,Clown,"Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse"
105127,Twelfth Night,9.0,5.1.11,Clown,for my friends.
105128,Twelfth Night,10.0,5.1.12,DUKE ORSINO,"Just the contrary, the better for thy friends."
105129,Twelfth Night,11.0,5.1.13,Clown,"No, sir, the worse."
105130,Twelfth Night,12.0,5.1.14,DUKE ORSINO,How can that be?
105131,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.15,Clown,"Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me,"
105132,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.16,Clown,now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
105133,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.17,Clown,"my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,"
105134,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.18,Clown,"and by my friends, I am abused: so that,"
105135,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.19,Clown,"conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives"
105136,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.20,Clown,"make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for"
105137,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.21,Clown,my friends and the better for my foes.
105138,Twelfth Night,14.0,5.1.22,DUKE ORSINO,"Why, this is excellent."
105139,Twelfth Night,15.0,5.1.23,Clown,"By my troth, sir, no, though it please you to be"
105140,Twelfth Night,15.0,5.1.24,Clown,one of my friends.
105141,Twelfth Night,16.0,5.1.25,DUKE ORSINO,Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
105142,Twelfth Night,17.0,5.1.26,Clown,"But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would"
105143,Twelfth Night,17.0,5.1.27,Clown,you could make it another.
105144,Twelfth Night,18.0,5.1.28,DUKE ORSINO,"O, you give me ill counsel."
105145,Twelfth Night,19.0,5.1.29,Clown,"Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,"
105146,Twelfth Night,19.0,5.1.30,Clown,and let your flesh and blood obey it.
105147,Twelfth Night,20.0,5.1.31,DUKE ORSINO,"Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a"
105148,Twelfth Night,20.0,5.1.32,DUKE ORSINO,double-dealer: there's another.
105149,Twelfth Night,21.0,5.1.33,Clown,"Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play, and the old"
105150,Twelfth Night,21.0,5.1.34,Clown,"saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,"
105151,Twelfth Night,21.0,5.1.35,Clown,"sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of"
105152,Twelfth Night,21.0,5.1.36,Clown,"Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind, one, two, three."
105153,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.37,DUKE ORSINO,You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
105154,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.38,DUKE ORSINO,if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
105155,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.39,DUKE ORSINO,"with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake"
105156,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.40,DUKE ORSINO,my bounty further.
105157,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.41,Clown,"Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come"
105158,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.42,Clown,"again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think"
105159,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.43,Clown,that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
105160,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.44,Clown,"but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I"
105161,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.45,Clown,will awake it anon.
105162,Twelfth Night,23.0,,Clown,Exit
105163,Twelfth Night,24.0,5.1.46,VIOLA,"Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me."
105164,Twelfth Night,24.0,,VIOLA,Enter ANTONIO and Officers
105165,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.47,DUKE ORSINO,"That face of his I do remember well,"
105166,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.48,DUKE ORSINO,"Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd"
105167,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.49,DUKE ORSINO,As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
105168,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.50,DUKE ORSINO,"A bawbling vessel was he captain of,"
105169,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.51,DUKE ORSINO,"For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,"
105170,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.52,DUKE ORSINO,With which such scathful grapple did he make
105171,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.53,DUKE ORSINO,"With the most noble bottom of our fleet,"
105172,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.54,DUKE ORSINO,That very envy and the tongue of loss
105173,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.55,DUKE ORSINO,Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
105174,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.56,First Officer,"Orsino, this is that Antonio"
105175,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.57,First Officer,"That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,"
105176,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.58,First Officer,"And this is he that did the Tiger board,"
105177,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.59,First Officer,When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
105178,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.60,First Officer,"Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,"
105179,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.61,First Officer,In private brabble did we apprehend him.
105180,Twelfth Night,27.0,5.1.62,VIOLA,"He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,"
105181,Twelfth Night,27.0,5.1.63,VIOLA,But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
105182,Twelfth Night,27.0,5.1.64,VIOLA,I know not what 'twas but distraction.
105183,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.65,DUKE ORSINO,Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
105184,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.66,DUKE ORSINO,"What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,"
105185,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.67,DUKE ORSINO,"Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,"
105186,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.68,DUKE ORSINO,Hast made thine enemies?
105187,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.69,ANTONIO,"Orsino, noble sir,"
105188,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.70,ANTONIO,Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
105189,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.71,ANTONIO,"Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,"
105190,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.72,ANTONIO,"Though I confess, on base and ground enough,"
105191,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.73,ANTONIO,Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
105192,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.74,ANTONIO,"That most ingrateful boy there by your side,"
105193,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.75,ANTONIO,From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
105194,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.76,ANTONIO,"Did I redeem, a wreck past hope he was:"
105195,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.77,ANTONIO,His life I gave him and did thereto add
105196,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.78,ANTONIO,"My love, without retention or restraint,"
105197,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.79,ANTONIO,"All his in dedication, for his sake"
105198,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.80,ANTONIO,"Did I expose myself, pure for his love,"
105199,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.81,ANTONIO,"Into the danger of this adverse town,"
105200,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.82,ANTONIO,Drew to defend him when he was beset:
105201,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.83,ANTONIO,"Where being apprehended, his false cunning,"
105202,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.84,ANTONIO,"Not meaning to partake with me in danger,"
105203,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.85,ANTONIO,"Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,"
105204,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.86,ANTONIO,And grew a twenty years removed thing
105205,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.87,ANTONIO,"While one would wink, denied me mine own purse,"
105206,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.88,ANTONIO,Which I had recommended to his use
105207,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.89,ANTONIO,Not half an hour before.
105208,Twelfth Night,30.0,5.1.90,VIOLA,How can this be?
105209,Twelfth Night,31.0,5.1.91,DUKE ORSINO,When came he to this town?
105210,Twelfth Night,32.0,5.1.92,ANTONIO,"To-day, my lord, and for three months before,"
105211,Twelfth Night,32.0,5.1.93,ANTONIO,"No interim, not a minute's vacancy,"
105212,Twelfth Night,32.0,5.1.94,ANTONIO,Both day and night did we keep company.
105213,Twelfth Night,32.0,,ANTONIO,Enter OLIVIA and Attendants
105214,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.95,DUKE ORSINO,Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
105215,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.96,DUKE ORSINO,"But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness:"
105216,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.97,DUKE ORSINO,"Three months this youth hath tended upon me,"
105217,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.98,DUKE ORSINO,But more of that anon. Take him aside.
105218,Twelfth Night,34.0,5.1.99,OLIVIA,"What would my lord, but that he may not have,"
105219,Twelfth Night,34.0,5.1.100,OLIVIA,Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
105220,Twelfth Night,34.0,5.1.101,OLIVIA,"Cesario, you do not keep promise with me."
105221,Twelfth Night,35.0,5.1.102,VIOLA,Madam!
105222,Twelfth Night,36.0,5.1.103,DUKE ORSINO,"Gracious Olivia,--"
105223,Twelfth Night,37.0,5.1.104,OLIVIA,"What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--"
105224,Twelfth Night,38.0,5.1.105,VIOLA,"My lord would speak, my duty hushes me."
105225,Twelfth Night,39.0,5.1.106,OLIVIA,"If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,"
105226,Twelfth Night,39.0,5.1.107,OLIVIA,It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
105227,Twelfth Night,39.0,5.1.108,OLIVIA,As howling after music.
105228,Twelfth Night,40.0,5.1.109,DUKE ORSINO,Still so cruel?
105229,Twelfth Night,41.0,5.1.110,OLIVIA,"Still so constant, lord."
105230,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.111,DUKE ORSINO,"What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,"
105231,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.112,DUKE ORSINO,To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
105232,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.113,DUKE ORSINO,My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
105233,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.114,DUKE ORSINO,That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
105234,Twelfth Night,43.0,5.1.115,OLIVIA,"Even what it please my lord, that shall become him."
105235,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.116,DUKE ORSINO,"Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,"

105335,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.211,SEBASTIAN,"But, had it been the brother of my blood,"
105336,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.212,SEBASTIAN,I must have done no less with wit and safety.
105337,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.213,SEBASTIAN,"You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that"
105338,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.214,SEBASTIAN,I do perceive it hath offended you:
105339,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.215,SEBASTIAN,"Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows"
105340,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.216,SEBASTIAN,We made each other but so late ago.
105341,Twelfth Night,80.0,5.1.217,DUKE ORSINO,"One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,"
105342,Twelfth Night,80.0,5.1.218,DUKE ORSINO,"A natural perspective, that is and is not!"
105343,Twelfth Night,81.0,5.1.219,SEBASTIAN,"Antonio, O my dear Antonio!"
105344,Twelfth Night,81.0,5.1.220,SEBASTIAN,"How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,"
105345,Twelfth Night,81.0,5.1.221,SEBASTIAN,Since I have lost thee!
105346,Twelfth Night,82.0,5.1.222,ANTONIO,Sebastian are you?
105347,Twelfth Night,83.0,5.1.223,SEBASTIAN,"Fear'st thou that, Antonio?"
105348,Twelfth Night,84.0,5.1.224,ANTONIO,How have you made division of yourself?
105349,Twelfth Night,84.0,5.1.225,ANTONIO,"An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin"
105350,Twelfth Night,84.0,5.1.226,ANTONIO,Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
105351,Twelfth Night,85.0,5.1.227,OLIVIA,Most wonderful!
105352,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.228,SEBASTIAN,"Do I stand there? I never had a brother,"
105353,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.229,SEBASTIAN,"Nor can there be that deity in my nature,"
105354,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.230,SEBASTIAN,"Of here and every where. I had a sister,"
105355,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.231,SEBASTIAN,Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
105356,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.232,SEBASTIAN,"Of charity, what kin are you to me?"
105357,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.233,SEBASTIAN,What countryman? what name? what parentage?
105358,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.234,VIOLA,"Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father,"
105359,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.235,VIOLA,"Such a Sebastian was my brother too,"
105360,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.236,VIOLA,So went he suited to his watery tomb:
105361,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.237,VIOLA,If spirits can assume both form and suit
105362,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.238,VIOLA,You come to fright us.
105363,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.239,SEBASTIAN,"A spirit I am indeed,"
105364,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.240,SEBASTIAN,But am in that dimension grossly clad
105365,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.241,SEBASTIAN,Which from the womb I did participate.
105366,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.242,SEBASTIAN,"Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,"
105367,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.243,SEBASTIAN,"I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,"
105368,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.244,SEBASTIAN,"And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'"
105369,Twelfth Night,89.0,5.1.245,VIOLA,My father had a mole upon his brow.
105370,Twelfth Night,90.0,5.1.246,SEBASTIAN,And so had mine.
105371,Twelfth Night,91.0,5.1.247,VIOLA,And died that day when Viola from her birth
105372,Twelfth Night,91.0,5.1.248,VIOLA,Had number'd thirteen years.
105373,Twelfth Night,92.0,5.1.249,SEBASTIAN,"O, that record is lively in my soul!"
105374,Twelfth Night,92.0,5.1.250,SEBASTIAN,He finished indeed his mortal act
105375,Twelfth Night,92.0,5.1.251,SEBASTIAN,That day that made my sister thirteen years.
105376,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.252,VIOLA,If nothing lets to make us happy both
105377,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.253,VIOLA,"But this my masculine usurp'd attire,"
105378,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.254,VIOLA,Do not embrace me till each circumstance
105379,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.255,VIOLA,"Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump"
105380,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.256,VIOLA,"That I am Viola: which to confirm,"
105381,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.257,VIOLA,"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,"
105382,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.258,VIOLA,"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help"
105383,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.259,VIOLA,I was preserved to serve this noble count.
105384,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.260,VIOLA,All the occurrence of my fortune since
105385,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.261,VIOLA,Hath been between this lady and this lord.
105386,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.262,SEBASTIAN,"[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:"
105387,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.263,SEBASTIAN,But nature to her bias drew in that.
105388,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.264,SEBASTIAN,"You would have been contracted to a maid,"
105389,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.265,SEBASTIAN,"Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,"
105390,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.266,SEBASTIAN,You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
105391,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.267,DUKE ORSINO,"Be not amazed, right noble is his blood."
105392,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.268,DUKE ORSINO,"If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,"
105393,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.269,DUKE ORSINO,I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
105394,Twelfth Night,95.0,,DUKE ORSINO,To VIOLA

105397,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.272,VIOLA,"And all those sayings will I overswear,"
105398,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.273,VIOLA,And those swearings keep as true in soul
105399,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.274,VIOLA,As doth that orbed continent the fire
105400,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.275,VIOLA,That severs day from night.
105401,Twelfth Night,97.0,5.1.276,DUKE ORSINO,"Give me thy hand,"
105402,Twelfth Night,97.0,5.1.277,DUKE ORSINO,And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
105403,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.278,VIOLA,The captain that did bring me first on shore
105404,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.279,VIOLA,Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
105405,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.280,VIOLA,"Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,"
105406,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.281,VIOLA,"A gentleman, and follower of my lady's."
105407,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.282,OLIVIA,He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
105408,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.283,OLIVIA,"And yet, alas, now I remember me,"
105409,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.284,OLIVIA,"They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract."
105410,Twelfth Night,99.0,,OLIVIA,"Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN"

105415,Twelfth Night,100.0,5.1.289,Clown,well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a

105417,Twelfth Night,100.0,5.1.291,Clown,"morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,"
105418,Twelfth Night,100.0,5.1.292,Clown,so it skills not much when they are delivered.
105419,Twelfth Night,101.0,5.1.293,OLIVIA,"Open't, and read it."

105438,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.310,FABIAN,"not but to do myself much right, or you much shame."
105439,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.311,FABIAN,Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
105440,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.312,FABIAN,unthought of and speak out of my injury.
105441,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.313,FABIAN,THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
105442,Twelfth Night,109.0,5.1.314,OLIVIA,Did he write this?
105443,Twelfth Night,110.0,5.1.315,Clown,"Ay, madam."
105444,Twelfth Night,111.0,5.1.316,DUKE ORSINO,This savours not much of distraction.
105445,Twelfth Night,112.0,5.1.317,OLIVIA,"See him deliver'd, Fabian, bring him hither."
105446,Twelfth Night,112.0,,OLIVIA,Exit FABIAN

105449,Twelfth Night,112.0,5.1.320,OLIVIA,"To think me as well a sister as a wife,"
105450,Twelfth Night,112.0,5.1.321,OLIVIA,"One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,"
105451,Twelfth Night,112.0,5.1.322,OLIVIA,Here at my house and at my proper cost.
105452,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.323,DUKE ORSINO,"Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer."
105453,Twelfth Night,113.0,,DUKE ORSINO,To VIOLA
105454,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.324,DUKE ORSINO,"Your master quits you, and for your service done him,"
105455,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.325,DUKE ORSINO,"So much against the mettle of your sex,"
105456,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.326,DUKE ORSINO,"So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,"
105457,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.327,DUKE ORSINO,"And since you call'd me master for so long,"
105458,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.328,DUKE ORSINO,Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
105459,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.329,DUKE ORSINO,Your master's mistress.
105460,Twelfth Night,114.0,5.1.330,OLIVIA,A sister! you are she.
105461,Twelfth Night,114.0,,OLIVIA,"Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO"
105462,Twelfth Night,115.0,5.1.331,DUKE ORSINO,Is this the madman?
105463,Twelfth Night,116.0,5.1.332,OLIVIA,"Ay, my lord, this same."
105464,Twelfth Night,116.0,5.1.333,OLIVIA,"How now, Malvolio!"
105465,Twelfth Night,117.0,5.1.334,MALVOLIO,"Madam, you have done me wrong,"
105466,Twelfth Night,117.0,5.1.335,MALVOLIO,Notorious wrong.
105467,Twelfth Night,118.0,5.1.336,OLIVIA,"Have I, Malvolio? no."
105468,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.337,MALVOLIO,"Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter."
105469,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.338,MALVOLIO,You must not now deny it is your hand:
105470,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.339,MALVOLIO,"Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase,"
105471,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.340,MALVOLIO,"Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:"
105472,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.341,MALVOLIO,"You can say none of this: well, grant it then"
105473,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.342,MALVOLIO,"And tell me, in the modesty of honour,"
105474,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.343,MALVOLIO,"Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,"
105475,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.344,MALVOLIO,"Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,"
105476,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.345,MALVOLIO,To put on yellow stockings and to frown
105477,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.346,MALVOLIO,"Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people,"
105478,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.347,MALVOLIO,"And, acting this in an obedient hope,"
105479,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.348,MALVOLIO,"Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,"
105480,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.349,MALVOLIO,"Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,"
105481,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.350,MALVOLIO,And made the most notorious geck and gull
105482,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.351,MALVOLIO,That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
105483,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.352,OLIVIA,"Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,"
105484,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.353,OLIVIA,"Though, I confess, much like the character"
105485,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.354,OLIVIA,But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
105486,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.355,OLIVIA,"And now I do bethink me, it was she"
105487,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.356,OLIVIA,"First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling,"
105488,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.357,OLIVIA,And in such forms which here were presupposed
105489,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.358,OLIVIA,"Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:"
105490,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.359,OLIVIA,"This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee,"
105491,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.360,OLIVIA,"But when we know the grounds and authors of it,"
105492,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.361,OLIVIA,Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
105493,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.362,OLIVIA,Of thine own cause.
105494,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.363,FABIAN,"Good madam, hear me speak,"
105495,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.364,FABIAN,And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
105496,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.365,FABIAN,"Taint the condition of this present hour,"
105497,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.366,FABIAN,"Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,"
105498,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.367,FABIAN,"Most freely I confess, myself and Toby"
105499,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.368,FABIAN,"Set this device against Malvolio here,"
105500,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.369,FABIAN,Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
105501,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.370,FABIAN,We had conceived against him: Maria writ
105502,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.371,FABIAN,"The letter at Sir Toby's great importance,"
105503,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.372,FABIAN,In recompense whereof he hath married her.
105504,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.373,FABIAN,"How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,"
105505,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.374,FABIAN,"May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,"
105506,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.375,FABIAN,If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
105507,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.376,FABIAN,That have on both sides pass'd.
105508,Twelfth Night,122.0,5.1.377,OLIVIA,"Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!"
105509,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.378,Clown,"Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,"
105510,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.379,Clown,and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
105511,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.380,Clown,"one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but"
105512,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.381,Clown,"that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'"
105513,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.382,Clown,"But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such"
105514,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.383,Clown,"a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'"
105515,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.384,Clown,and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
105516,Twelfth Night,124.0,5.1.385,MALVOLIO,I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
105517,Twelfth Night,124.0,,MALVOLIO,Exit
105518,Twelfth Night,125.0,5.1.386,OLIVIA,He hath been most notoriously abused.
105519,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.387,DUKE ORSINO,Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
105520,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.388,DUKE ORSINO,He hath not told us of the captain yet:
105521,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.389,DUKE ORSINO,"When that is known and golden time convents,"
105522,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.390,DUKE ORSINO,A solemn combination shall be made
105523,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.391,DUKE ORSINO,"Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,"
105524,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.392,DUKE ORSINO,"We will not part from hence. Cesario, come,"
105525,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.393,DUKE ORSINO,"For so you shall be, while you are a man,"
105526,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.394,DUKE ORSINO,"But when in other habits you are seen,"
105527,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.395,DUKE ORSINO,Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.

105532,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.399,Clown,"A foolish thing was but a toy,"
105533,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.400,Clown,For the rain it raineth every day.
105534,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.401,Clown,"But when I came to man's estate,"
105535,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.402,Clown,"With hey, ho,  and c."

105537,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.404,Clown,"For the rain,  and c."
105538,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.405,Clown,"But when I came, alas! to wive,"
105539,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.406,Clown,"With hey, ho,  and c."
105540,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.407,Clown,"By swaggering could I never thrive,"
105541,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.408,Clown,"For the rain,  and c."
105542,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.409,Clown,"But when I came unto my beds,"

105554,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.1,VALENTINE,"Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:"
105555,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.2,VALENTINE,Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
105556,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.3,VALENTINE,Were't not affection chains thy tender days
105557,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.4,VALENTINE,"To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,"
105558,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.5,VALENTINE,I rather would entreat thy company
105559,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.6,VALENTINE,"To see the wonders of the world abroad,"
105560,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.7,VALENTINE,"Than, living dully sluggardized at home,"
105561,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.8,VALENTINE,Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
105562,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.9,VALENTINE,"But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,"
105563,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.10,VALENTINE,Even as I would when I to love begin.
105564,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.11,PROTEUS,"Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!"
105565,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.12,PROTEUS,"Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest"
105566,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.13,PROTEUS,Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
105567,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.14,PROTEUS,Wish me partaker in thy happiness
105568,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.15,PROTEUS,"When thou dost meet good hap, and in thy danger,"
105569,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.16,PROTEUS,"If ever danger do environ thee,"
105570,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.17,PROTEUS,"Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,"
105571,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.18,PROTEUS,"For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine."
105572,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.1.19,VALENTINE,And on a love-book pray for my success?
105573,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.1.20,PROTEUS,Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
105574,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.1.21,VALENTINE,That's on some shallow story of deep love:
105575,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.1.22,VALENTINE,How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
105576,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.1.23,PROTEUS,That's a deep story of a deeper love:
105577,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.1.24,PROTEUS,For he was more than over shoes in love.
105578,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,1.1.25,VALENTINE,"'Tis true, for you are over boots in love,"
105579,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,1.1.26,VALENTINE,And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
105580,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.1.27,PROTEUS,"Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots."
105581,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,1.1.28,VALENTINE,"No, I will not, for it boots thee not."
105582,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,1.1.29,PROTEUS,What?
105583,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.30,VALENTINE,"To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,"
105584,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.31,VALENTINE,"Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment's mirth"
105585,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.32,VALENTINE,"With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:"
105586,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.33,VALENTINE,"If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain,"
105587,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.34,VALENTINE,"If lost, why then a grievous labour won,"
105588,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.35,VALENTINE,"However, but a folly bought with wit,"
105589,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.36,VALENTINE,Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
105590,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,1.1.37,PROTEUS,"So, by your circumstance, you call me fool."
105591,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,1.1.38,VALENTINE,"So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove."
105592,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,1.1.39,PROTEUS,'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
105593,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,1.1.40,VALENTINE,"Love is your master, for he masters you:"
105594,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,1.1.41,VALENTINE,"And he that is so yoked by a fool,"
105595,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,1.1.42,VALENTINE,"Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise."
105596,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.1.43,PROTEUS,"Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud"
105597,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.1.44,PROTEUS,"The eating canker dwells, so eating love"
105598,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.1.45,PROTEUS,Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
105599,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.46,VALENTINE,"And writers say, as the most forward bud"
105600,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.47,VALENTINE,"Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,"
105601,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.48,VALENTINE,Even so by love the young and tender wit
105602,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.49,VALENTINE,"Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,"
105603,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.50,VALENTINE,Losing his verdure even in the prime
105604,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.51,VALENTINE,And all the fair effects of future hopes.
105605,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.52,VALENTINE,"But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,"
105606,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.53,VALENTINE,That art a votary to fond desire?
105607,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.54,VALENTINE,Once more adieu! my father at the road
105608,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.55,VALENTINE,"Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd."
105609,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,1.1.56,PROTEUS,"And thither will I bring thee, Valentine."
105610,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.57,VALENTINE,"Sweet Proteus, no, now let us take our leave."
105611,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.58,VALENTINE,To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
105612,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.59,VALENTINE,"Of thy success in love, and what news else"
105613,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.60,VALENTINE,"Betideth here in absence of thy friend,"
105614,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.61,VALENTINE,And likewise will visit thee with mine.
105615,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,1.1.62,PROTEUS,All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
105616,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,1.1.63,VALENTINE,"As much to you at home! and so, farewell."

105619,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.65,PROTEUS,"He leaves his friends to dignify them more,"
105620,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.66,PROTEUS,"I leave myself, my friends and all, for love."
105621,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.67,PROTEUS,"Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,"
105622,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.68,PROTEUS,"Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,"
105623,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.69,PROTEUS,"War with good counsel, set the world at nought,"
105624,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.70,PROTEUS,"Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought."
105625,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,,PROTEUS,Enter SPEED
105626,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,1.1.71,SPEED,"Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?"
105627,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,1.1.72,PROTEUS,"But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan."
105628,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,1.1.73,SPEED,"Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,"
105629,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,1.1.74,SPEED,And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
105630,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,1.1.75,PROTEUS,"Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,"
105631,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,1.1.76,PROTEUS,An if the shepherd be a while away.
105632,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,1.1.77,SPEED,"You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,"
105633,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,1.1.78,SPEED,and I a sheep?
105634,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,1.1.79,PROTEUS,I do.
105635,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,1.1.80,SPEED,"Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep."
105636,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.1.81,PROTEUS,A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
105637,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.1.82,SPEED,This proves me still a sheep.
105638,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,1.1.83,PROTEUS,"True, and thy master a shepherd."
105639,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,1.1.84,SPEED,"Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance."
105640,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,1.1.85,PROTEUS,It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
105641,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.1.86,SPEED,"The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the"
105642,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.1.87,SPEED,"shepherd, but I seek my master, and my master seeks"
105643,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.1.88,SPEED,not me: therefore I am no sheep.
105644,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.1.89,PROTEUS,"The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the"
105645,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.1.90,PROTEUS,shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
105646,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.1.91,PROTEUS,"wages followest thy master, thy master for wages"
105647,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.1.92,PROTEUS,follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
105648,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,1.1.93,SPEED,Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
105649,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,1.1.94,PROTEUS,"But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?"
105650,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,1.1.95,SPEED,"Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,"
105651,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,1.1.96,SPEED,"a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a"
105652,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,1.1.97,SPEED,"lost mutton, nothing for my labour."
105653,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,1.1.98,PROTEUS,Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
105654,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,1.1.99,SPEED,"If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her."
105655,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,1.1.100,PROTEUS,"Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you."
105656,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,1.1.101,SPEED,"Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for"
105657,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,1.1.102,SPEED,carrying your letter.
105658,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,1.1.103,PROTEUS,"You mistake, I mean the pound,--a pinfold."
105659,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,1.1.104,SPEED,"From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,"
105660,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,1.1.105,SPEED,'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
105661,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,1.1.106,SPEED,your lover.
105662,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,1.1.107,PROTEUS,But what said she?
105663,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,1.1.108,SPEED,[First nodding]  Ay.
105664,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,1.1.109,PROTEUS,"Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy."
105665,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,1.1.110,SPEED,"You mistook, sir, I say, she did nod: and you ask"
105666,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,1.1.111,SPEED,"me if she did nod, and I say, 'Ay.'"
105667,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,1.1.112,PROTEUS,And that set together is noddy.
105668,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,1.1.113,SPEED,"Now you have taken the pains to set it together,"
105669,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,1.1.114,SPEED,take it for your pains.
105670,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,1.1.115,PROTEUS,"No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter."
105671,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,1.1.116,SPEED,"Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you."
105672,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,1.1.117,PROTEUS,"Why sir, how do you bear with me?"
105673,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,1.1.118,SPEED,"Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing"
105674,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,1.1.119,SPEED,but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
105675,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,1.1.120,PROTEUS,"Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit."
105676,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,1.1.121,SPEED,And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
105677,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,1.1.122,PROTEUS,"Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?"
105678,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,1.1.123,SPEED,"Open your purse, that the money and the matter may"
105679,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,1.1.124,SPEED,be both at once delivered.
105680,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,1.1.125,PROTEUS,"Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?"
105681,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,1.1.126,SPEED,"Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her."
105682,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,1.1.127,PROTEUS,"Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?"
105683,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.128,SPEED,"Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her, no,"
105684,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.129,SPEED,not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
105685,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.130,SPEED,"and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I"
105686,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.131,SPEED,fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
105687,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.132,SPEED,"mind. Give her no token but stones, for she's as"
105688,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.133,SPEED,hard as steel.
105689,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,1.1.134,PROTEUS,What said she? nothing?
105690,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.1.135,SPEED,"No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To"
105691,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.1.136,SPEED,"testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned"
105692,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.1.137,SPEED,"me, in requital whereof, henceforth carry your"
105693,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.1.138,SPEED,"letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master."
105694,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.139,PROTEUS,"Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,"
105695,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.140,PROTEUS,"Which cannot perish having thee aboard,"
105696,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.141,PROTEUS,Being destined to a drier death on shore.
105697,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,,PROTEUS,Exit SPEED
105698,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.142,PROTEUS,I must go send some better messenger:
105699,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.143,PROTEUS,"I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,"
105700,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.144,PROTEUS,Receiving them from such a worthless post.
105701,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
105702,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,,PROTEUS,SCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house.
105703,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,,PROTEUS,Enter JULlA and LUCETTA
105704,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.2.1,JULIA,"But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,"
105705,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.2.2,JULIA,Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
105706,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.2.3,LUCETTA,"Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully."
105707,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.2.4,JULIA,Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
105708,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.2.5,JULIA,"That every day with parle encounter me,"
105709,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.2.6,JULIA,In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
105710,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.2.7,LUCETTA,"Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind"
105711,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.2.8,LUCETTA,According to my shallow simple skill.
105712,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.2.9,JULIA,What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
105713,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.2.10,LUCETTA,"As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine,"
105714,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.2.11,LUCETTA,"But, were I you, he never should be mine."
105715,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,1.2.12,JULIA,What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
105716,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.2.13,LUCETTA,"Well of his wealth, but of himself, so so."
105717,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,1.2.14,JULIA,What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
105718,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,1.2.15,LUCETTA,"Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!"
105719,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.2.16,JULIA,How now! what means this passion at his name?
105720,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,1.2.17,LUCETTA,"Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame"
105721,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,1.2.18,LUCETTA,"That I, unworthy body as I am,"
105722,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,1.2.19,LUCETTA,Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
105723,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,1.2.20,JULIA,"Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?"
105724,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,1.2.21,LUCETTA,Then thus: of many good I think him best.
105725,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,1.2.22,JULIA,Your reason?
105726,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.2.23,LUCETTA,"I have no other, but a woman's reason,"
105727,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.2.24,LUCETTA,I think him so because I think him so.
105728,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.2.25,JULIA,And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
105729,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,1.2.26,LUCETTA,"Ay, if you thought your love not cast away."
105730,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.2.27,JULIA,"Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me."
105731,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,1.2.28,LUCETTA,"Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye."
105732,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,1.2.29,JULIA,His little speaking shows his love but small.
105733,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.2.30,LUCETTA,Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
105734,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,1.2.31,JULIA,They do not love that do not show their love.
105735,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,1.2.32,LUCETTA,"O, they love least that let men know their love."
105736,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,1.2.33,JULIA,I would I knew his mind.
105737,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,1.2.34,LUCETTA,"Peruse this paper, madam."
105738,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,1.2.35,JULIA,"'To Julia.' Say, from whom?"
105739,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,1.2.36,LUCETTA,That the contents will show.
105740,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,1.2.37,JULIA,"Say, say, who gave it thee?"
105741,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.2.38,LUCETTA,"Valentine's page, and sent, I think, from Proteus."
105742,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.2.39,LUCETTA,"He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,"
105743,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.2.40,LUCETTA,Did in your name receive it: pardon the
105744,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.2.41,LUCETTA,fault I pray.
105745,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.42,JULIA,"Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!"
105746,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.43,JULIA,Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
105747,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.44,JULIA,To whisper and conspire against my youth?
105748,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.45,JULIA,"Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth"
105749,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.46,JULIA,And you an officer fit for the place.
105750,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.47,JULIA,Or else return no more into my sight.
105751,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,1.2.48,LUCETTA,To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
105752,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,1.2.49,JULIA,Will ye be gone?
105753,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,1.2.50,LUCETTA,That you may ruminate.
105754,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,,LUCETTA,Exit
105755,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.51,JULIA,And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
105756,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.52,JULIA,It were a shame to call her back again
105757,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.53,JULIA,And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
105758,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.54,JULIA,"What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,"
105759,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.55,JULIA,And would not force the letter to my view!
105760,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.56,JULIA,"Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that"
105761,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.57,JULIA,Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
105762,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.58,JULIA,"Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love"
105763,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.59,JULIA,"That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse"
105764,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.60,JULIA,And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
105765,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.61,JULIA,"How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,"
105766,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.62,JULIA,When willingly I would have had her here!
105767,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.63,JULIA,"How angerly I taught my brow to frown,"
105768,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.64,JULIA,When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
105769,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.65,JULIA,My penance is to call Lucetta back
105770,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.66,JULIA,And ask remission for my folly past.
105771,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.67,JULIA,What ho! Lucetta!
105772,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,,JULIA,Re-enter LUCETTA
105773,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.2.68,LUCETTA,What would your ladyship?
105774,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,1.2.69,JULIA,Is't near dinner-time?
105775,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,1.2.70,LUCETTA,"I would it were,"
105776,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,1.2.71,LUCETTA,That you might kill your stomach on your meat
105777,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,1.2.72,LUCETTA,And not upon your maid.
105778,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,1.2.73,JULIA,What is't that you took up so gingerly?
105779,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,1.2.74,LUCETTA,Nothing.
105780,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,1.2.75,JULIA,"Why didst thou stoop, then?"
105781,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,1.2.76,LUCETTA,To take a paper up that I let fall.
105782,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,1.2.77,JULIA,And is that paper nothing?
105783,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,1.2.78,LUCETTA,Nothing concerning me.
105784,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,1.2.79,JULIA,Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
105785,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,1.2.80,LUCETTA,"Madam, it will not lie where it concerns"
105786,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,1.2.81,LUCETTA,Unless it have a false interpeter.
105787,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,1.2.82,JULIA,Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
105788,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,1.2.83,LUCETTA,"That I might sing it, madam, to a tune."
105789,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,1.2.84,LUCETTA,Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
105790,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,1.2.85,JULIA,As little by such toys as may be possible.
105791,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,1.2.86,JULIA,Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
105792,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,1.2.87,LUCETTA,It is too heavy for so light a tune.
105793,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,1.2.88,JULIA,Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
105794,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,1.2.89,LUCETTA,"Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it."
105795,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,1.2.90,JULIA,And why not you?
105796,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,1.2.91,LUCETTA,I cannot reach so high.
105797,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,1.2.92,JULIA,"Let's see your song. How now, minion!"
105798,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,1.2.93,LUCETTA,"Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:"
105799,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,1.2.94,LUCETTA,And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
105800,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,1.2.95,JULIA,You do not?
105801,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,1.2.96,LUCETTA,"No, madam, it is too sharp."
105802,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,1.2.97,JULIA,"You, minion, are too saucy."
105803,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,1.2.98,LUCETTA,"Nay, now you are too flat"
105804,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,1.2.99,LUCETTA,And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
105805,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,1.2.100,LUCETTA,There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
105806,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,1.2.101,JULIA,The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
105807,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,1.2.102,LUCETTA,"Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus."
105808,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.2.103,JULIA,This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
105809,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.2.104,JULIA,Here is a coil with protestation!
105810,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,,JULIA,Tears the letter
105811,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.2.105,JULIA,"Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:"
105812,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.2.106,JULIA,"You would be fingering them, to anger me."
105813,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,1.2.107,LUCETTA,"She makes it strange, but she would be best pleased"
105814,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,1.2.108,LUCETTA,To be so anger'd with another letter.
105815,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,,LUCETTA,Exit
105816,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.109,JULIA,"Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!"
105817,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.110,JULIA,"O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!"
105818,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.111,JULIA,"Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey"
105819,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.112,JULIA,And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
105820,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.113,JULIA,I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
105821,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.114,JULIA,"Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!"
105822,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.115,JULIA,"As in revenge of thy ingratitude,"
105823,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.116,JULIA,"I throw thy name against the bruising stones,"
105824,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.117,JULIA,Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
105825,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.118,JULIA,And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
105826,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.119,JULIA,Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
105827,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.120,JULIA,"Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd,"
105828,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.121,JULIA,And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
105829,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.122,JULIA,But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
105830,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.123,JULIA,"Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away"
105831,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.124,JULIA,"Till I have found each letter in the letter,"
105832,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.125,JULIA,Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
105833,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.126,JULIA,Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
105834,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.127,JULIA,And throw it thence into the raging sea!
105835,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.128,JULIA,"Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,"
105836,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.129,JULIA,"'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,"
105837,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.130,JULIA,To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
105838,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.131,JULIA,"And yet I will not, sith so prettily"
105839,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.132,JULIA,He couples it to his complaining names.

105846,Two Gentlemen of Verona,68.0,1.2.138,LUCETTA,"What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?"
105847,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,1.2.139,JULIA,"If you respect them, best to take them up."
105848,Two Gentlemen of Verona,70.0,1.2.140,LUCETTA,"Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:"
105849,Two Gentlemen of Verona,70.0,1.2.141,LUCETTA,"Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold."

105859,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.3.3,PANTHINO,"'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son."
105860,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.3.4,ANTONIO,"Why, what of him?"
105861,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.5,PANTHINO,He wonder'd that your lordship
105862,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.6,PANTHINO,"Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,"
105863,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.7,PANTHINO,"While other men, of slender reputation,"
105864,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.8,PANTHINO,Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:

105872,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.16,PANTHINO,"Which would be great impeachment to his age,"
105873,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.17,PANTHINO,In having known no travel in his youth.
105874,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.18,ANTONIO,Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
105875,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.19,ANTONIO,Whereon this month I have been hammering.
105876,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.20,ANTONIO,I have consider'd well his loss of time
105877,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.21,ANTONIO,"And how he cannot be a perfect man,"
105878,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.22,ANTONIO,Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:

105885,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,1.3.29,ANTONIO,I know it well.
105886,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.3.30,PANTHINO,"'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:"
105887,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.3.31,PANTHINO,"There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,"
105888,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.3.32,PANTHINO,"Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen."

105915,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.3.58,PROTEUS,"How happily he lives, how well beloved"
105916,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.3.59,PROTEUS,"And daily graced by the emperor,"

105945,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.87,PROTEUS,"Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,"
105946,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.88,PROTEUS,And by and by a cloud takes all away!
105947,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,,PROTEUS,Re-enter PANTHINO
105948,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,1.3.89,PANTHINO,"Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:"

105986,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.31,SPEED,"on you, I can hardly think you my master."

106020,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,2.1.65,VALENTINE,Why?

106032,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,2.1.77,SPEED,"you swinged me for my love, which makes me the"

106034,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.1.79,VALENTINE,"In conclusion, I stand affected to her."
106035,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,2.1.80,SPEED,"I would you were set, so your affection would cease."
106036,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,2.1.81,VALENTINE,Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
106037,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,2.1.82,VALENTINE,one she loves.

106056,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,2.1.100,VALENTINE,For being ignorant to whom it goes
106057,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,2.1.101,VALENTINE,"I writ at random, very doubtfully."
106058,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,2.1.102,SILVIA,Perchance you think too much of so much pains?

106087,Two Gentlemen of Verona,73.0,2.1.130,SPEED,"That my master, being scribe, to himself should write"
106088,Two Gentlemen of Verona,73.0,2.1.131,SPEED,the letter?
106089,Two Gentlemen of Verona,74.0,2.1.132,VALENTINE,"How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?"
106090,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.1.133,SPEED,"Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason."

106096,Two Gentlemen of Verona,81.0,2.1.139,SPEED,"By a letter, I should say."
106097,Two Gentlemen of Verona,82.0,2.1.140,VALENTINE,"Why, she hath not writ to me?"

106109,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.1.152,SPEED,"For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,"
106110,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.1.153,SPEED,"Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply,"
106111,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.1.154,SPEED,"Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,"
106112,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.1.155,SPEED,Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
106113,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.1.156,SPEED,"All this I speak in print, for in print I found it."

106252,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,2.4.39,VALENTINE,"and, I think, no other treasure to give your"
106253,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,2.4.40,VALENTINE,"followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,"
106254,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,2.4.41,VALENTINE,that they live by your bare words.
106255,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,2.4.42,SILVIA,"No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father."
106256,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,,SILVIA,Enter DUKE
106257,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,2.4.43,DUKE,"Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset."
106258,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,2.4.44,DUKE,"Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:"
106259,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,2.4.45,DUKE,What say you to a letter from your friends
106260,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,2.4.46,DUKE,Of much good news?
106261,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,2.4.47,VALENTINE,"My lord, I will be thankful."
106262,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,2.4.48,VALENTINE,To any happy messenger from thence.
106263,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,2.4.49,DUKE,"Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?"
106264,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,2.4.50,VALENTINE,"Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman"
106265,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,2.4.51,VALENTINE,To be of worth and worthy estimation
106266,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,2.4.52,VALENTINE,And not without desert so well reputed.
106267,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,2.4.53,DUKE,Hath he not a son?
106268,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,2.4.54,VALENTINE,"Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves"
106269,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,2.4.55,VALENTINE,The honour and regard of such a father.
106270,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,2.4.56,DUKE,You know him well?
106271,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.57,VALENTINE,"I know him as myself, for from our infancy"
106272,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.58,VALENTINE,We have conversed and spent our hours together:
106273,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.59,VALENTINE,"And though myself have been an idle truant,"
106274,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.60,VALENTINE,Omitting the sweet benefit of time
106275,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.61,VALENTINE,"To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,"
106276,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.62,VALENTINE,"Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,"
106277,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.63,VALENTINE,"Made use and fair advantage of his days,"
106278,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.64,VALENTINE,"His years but young, but his experience old,"
106279,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.65,VALENTINE,"His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe,"
106280,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.66,VALENTINE,"And, in a word, for far behind his worth"
106281,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.67,VALENTINE,"Comes all the praises that I now bestow,"
106282,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.68,VALENTINE,He is complete in feature and in mind
106283,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.69,VALENTINE,With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
106284,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.70,DUKE,"Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,"
106285,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.71,DUKE,He is as worthy for an empress' love
106286,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.72,DUKE,As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
106287,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.73,DUKE,"Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,"
106288,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.74,DUKE,"With commendation from great potentates,"
106289,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.75,DUKE,And here he means to spend his time awhile:
106290,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.76,DUKE,I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
106291,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,2.4.77,VALENTINE,"Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he."
106292,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.4.78,DUKE,Welcome him then according to his worth.
106293,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.4.79,DUKE,"Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio,"
106294,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.4.80,DUKE,"For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:"
106295,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.4.81,DUKE,I will send him hither to you presently.
106296,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,,DUKE,Exit
106297,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,2.4.82,VALENTINE,This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
106298,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,2.4.83,VALENTINE,"Had come along with me, but that his mistress"
106299,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,2.4.84,VALENTINE,Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
106300,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,2.4.85,SILVIA,Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
106301,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,2.4.86,SILVIA,Upon some other pawn for fealty.
106302,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,2.4.87,VALENTINE,"Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still."
106303,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,2.4.88,SILVIA,"Nay, then he should be blind, and, being blind"
106304,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,2.4.89,SILVIA,How could he see his way to seek out you?
106305,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,2.4.90,VALENTINE,"Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes."
106306,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,2.4.91,THURIO,They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
106307,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,2.4.92,VALENTINE,"To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:"
106308,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,2.4.93,VALENTINE,Upon a homely object Love can wink.
106309,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,2.4.94,SILVIA,"Have done, have done, here comes the gentleman."
106310,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,,SILVIA,Exit THURIO
106311,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,,SILVIA,Enter PROTEUS
106312,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,2.4.95,VALENTINE,"Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,"
106313,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,2.4.96,VALENTINE,Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
106314,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,2.4.97,SILVIA,"His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,"
106315,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,2.4.98,SILVIA,If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
106316,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,2.4.99,VALENTINE,"Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him"
106317,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,2.4.100,VALENTINE,To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
106318,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,2.4.101,SILVIA,Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
106319,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,2.4.102,PROTEUS,"Not so, sweet  lady: but too mean a servant"
106320,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,2.4.103,PROTEUS,To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
106321,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,2.4.104,VALENTINE,Leave off discourse of disability:
106322,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,2.4.105,VALENTINE,"Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant."
106323,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,2.4.106,PROTEUS,"My duty will I boast of, nothing else."
106324,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,2.4.107,SILVIA,And duty never yet did want his meed:
106325,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,2.4.108,SILVIA,"Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress."
106326,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,2.4.109,PROTEUS,I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
106327,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,2.4.110,SILVIA,That you are welcome?
106328,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,2.4.111,PROTEUS,That you are worthless.
106329,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,,PROTEUS,Re-enter THURIO
106330,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,2.4.112,THURIO,"Madam, my lord your father would speak with you."
106331,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,2.4.113,SILVIA,"I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,"
106332,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,2.4.114,SILVIA,"Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:"
106333,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,2.4.115,SILVIA,"I'll leave you to confer of home affairs,"
106334,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,2.4.116,SILVIA,"When you have done, we look to hear from you."
106335,Two Gentlemen of Verona,68.0,2.4.117,PROTEUS,We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
106336,Two Gentlemen of Verona,68.0,,PROTEUS,Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO
106337,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,2.4.118,VALENTINE,"Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?"
106338,Two Gentlemen of Verona,70.0,2.4.119,PROTEUS,Your friends are well and have them much commended.
106339,Two Gentlemen of Verona,71.0,2.4.120,VALENTINE,And how do yours?
106340,Two Gentlemen of Verona,72.0,2.4.121,PROTEUS,I left them all in health.
106341,Two Gentlemen of Verona,73.0,2.4.122,VALENTINE,How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
106342,Two Gentlemen of Verona,74.0,2.4.123,PROTEUS,"My tales of love were wont to weary you,"
106343,Two Gentlemen of Verona,74.0,2.4.124,PROTEUS,I know you joy not in a love discourse.
106344,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.125,VALENTINE,"Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:"
106345,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.126,VALENTINE,"I have done penance for contemning Love,"
106346,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.127,VALENTINE,Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
106347,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.128,VALENTINE,"With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,"
106348,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.129,VALENTINE,"With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs,"
106349,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.130,VALENTINE,"For in revenge of my contempt of love,"
106350,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.131,VALENTINE,Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
106351,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.132,VALENTINE,And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
106352,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.133,VALENTINE,"O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,"
106353,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.134,VALENTINE,"And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,"
106354,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.135,VALENTINE,"There is no woe to his correction,"
106355,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.136,VALENTINE,Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
106356,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.137,VALENTINE,"Now no discourse, except it be of love,"
106357,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.138,VALENTINE,"Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,"
106358,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.139,VALENTINE,Upon the very naked name of love.
106359,Two Gentlemen of Verona,76.0,2.4.140,PROTEUS,"Enough, I read your fortune in your eye."
106360,Two Gentlemen of Verona,76.0,2.4.141,PROTEUS,Was this the idol that you worship so?
106361,Two Gentlemen of Verona,77.0,2.4.142,VALENTINE,"Even she, and is she not a heavenly saint?"
106362,Two Gentlemen of Verona,78.0,2.4.143,PROTEUS,"No, but she is an earthly paragon."
106363,Two Gentlemen of Verona,79.0,2.4.144,VALENTINE,Call her divine.
106364,Two Gentlemen of Verona,80.0,2.4.145,PROTEUS,I will not flatter her.
106365,Two Gentlemen of Verona,81.0,2.4.146,VALENTINE,"O, flatter me, for love delights in praises."
106366,Two Gentlemen of Verona,82.0,2.4.147,PROTEUS,"When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,"
106367,Two Gentlemen of Verona,82.0,2.4.148,PROTEUS,And I must minister the like to you.
106368,Two Gentlemen of Verona,83.0,2.4.149,VALENTINE,"Then speak the truth by her, if not divine,"
106369,Two Gentlemen of Verona,83.0,2.4.150,VALENTINE,"Yet let her be a principality,"
106370,Two Gentlemen of Verona,83.0,2.4.151,VALENTINE,Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
106371,Two Gentlemen of Verona,84.0,2.4.152,PROTEUS,Except my mistress.
106372,Two Gentlemen of Verona,85.0,2.4.153,VALENTINE,"Sweet, except not any,"
106373,Two Gentlemen of Verona,85.0,2.4.154,VALENTINE,Except thou wilt except against my love.
106374,Two Gentlemen of Verona,86.0,2.4.155,PROTEUS,Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
106375,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.156,VALENTINE,And I will help thee to prefer her too:
106376,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.157,VALENTINE,She shall be dignified with this high honour--
106377,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.158,VALENTINE,"To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth"
106378,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.159,VALENTINE,Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
106379,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.160,VALENTINE,"And, of so great a favour growing proud,"
106380,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.161,VALENTINE,Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
106381,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.162,VALENTINE,And make rough winter everlastingly.
106382,Two Gentlemen of Verona,88.0,2.4.163,PROTEUS,"Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?"
106383,Two Gentlemen of Verona,89.0,2.4.164,VALENTINE,"Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing"
106384,Two Gentlemen of Verona,89.0,2.4.165,VALENTINE,"To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing,"
106385,Two Gentlemen of Verona,89.0,2.4.166,VALENTINE,She is alone.
106386,Two Gentlemen of Verona,90.0,2.4.167,PROTEUS,Then let her alone.
106387,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.168,VALENTINE,"Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,"
106388,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.169,VALENTINE,And I as rich in having such a jewel
106389,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.170,VALENTINE,"As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,"
106390,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.171,VALENTINE,The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
106391,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.172,VALENTINE,"Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,"
106392,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.173,VALENTINE,Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
106393,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.174,VALENTINE,"My foolish rival, that her father likes"
106394,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.175,VALENTINE,"Only for his possessions are so huge,"
106395,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.176,VALENTINE,"Is gone with her along, and I must after,"
106396,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.177,VALENTINE,"For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy."
106397,Two Gentlemen of Verona,92.0,2.4.178,PROTEUS,But she loves you?
106398,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.179,VALENTINE,"Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,"
106399,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.180,VALENTINE,"marriage-hour,"
106400,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.181,VALENTINE,"With all the cunning manner of our flight,"
106401,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.182,VALENTINE,"Determined of, how I must climb her window,"
106402,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.183,VALENTINE,"The ladder made of cords, and all the means"
106403,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.184,VALENTINE,Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
106404,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.185,VALENTINE,"Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,"
106405,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.186,VALENTINE,In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
106406,Two Gentlemen of Verona,94.0,2.4.187,PROTEUS,"Go on before, I shall inquire you forth:"
106407,Two Gentlemen of Verona,94.0,2.4.188,PROTEUS,"I must unto the road, to disembark"
106408,Two Gentlemen of Verona,94.0,2.4.189,PROTEUS,"Some necessaries that I needs must use,"
106409,Two Gentlemen of Verona,94.0,2.4.190,PROTEUS,And then I'll presently attend you.
106410,Two Gentlemen of Verona,95.0,2.4.191,VALENTINE,Will you make haste?
106411,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.192,PROTEUS,I will.
106412,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,,PROTEUS,Exit VALENTINE
106413,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.193,PROTEUS,"Even as one heat another heat expels,"
106414,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.194,PROTEUS,"Or as one nail by strength drives out another,"
106415,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.195,PROTEUS,So the remembrance of my former love
106416,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.196,PROTEUS,Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
106417,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.197,PROTEUS,"Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,"
106418,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.198,PROTEUS,"Her true perfection, or my false transgression,"
106419,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.199,PROTEUS,That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
106420,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.200,PROTEUS,"She is fair, and so is Julia that I love--"
106421,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.201,PROTEUS,"That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd,"
106422,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.202,PROTEUS,"Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,"
106423,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.203,PROTEUS,Bears no impression of the thing it was.
106424,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.204,PROTEUS,"Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,"
106425,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.205,PROTEUS,And that I love him not as I was wont.
106426,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.206,PROTEUS,"O, but I love his lady too too much,"
106427,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.207,PROTEUS,And that's the reason I love him so little.
106428,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.208,PROTEUS,"How shall I dote on her with more advice,"
106429,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.209,PROTEUS,That thus without advice begin to love her!
106430,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.210,PROTEUS,"'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,"
106431,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.211,PROTEUS,"And that hath dazzled my reason's light,"
106432,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.212,PROTEUS,"But when I look on her perfections,"
106433,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.213,PROTEUS,There is no reason but I shall be blind.
106434,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.214,PROTEUS,"If I can cheque my erring love, I will,"
106435,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.215,PROTEUS,"If not, to compass her I'll use my skill."
106436,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
106437,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,,PROTEUS,SCENE V. The same. A street.
106438,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,,PROTEUS,Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally
106439,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.5.1,SPEED,"Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!"
106440,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.2,LAUNCE,"Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not"
106441,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.3,LAUNCE,"welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never"
106442,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.4,LAUNCE,"undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a"
106443,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.5,LAUNCE,place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
106444,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.6,LAUNCE,say 'Welcome!'
106445,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.5.7,SPEED,"Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you"
106446,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.5.8,SPEED,"presently, where, for one shot of five pence, thou"
106447,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.5.9,SPEED,"shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how"
106448,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.5.10,SPEED,did thy master part with Madam Julia?
106449,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,2.5.11,LAUNCE,"Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very"
106450,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,2.5.12,LAUNCE,fairly in jest.
106451,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.5.13,SPEED,But shall she marry him?
106452,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,2.5.14,LAUNCE,No.
106453,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.5.15,SPEED,How then? shall he marry her?
106454,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,2.5.16,LAUNCE,"No, neither."
106455,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.5.17,SPEED,"What, are they broken?"
106456,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,2.5.18,LAUNCE,"No, they are both as whole as a fish."
106457,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.5.19,SPEED,"Why, then, how stands the matter with them?"
106458,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,2.5.20,LAUNCE,"Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it"
106459,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,2.5.21,LAUNCE,stands well with her.
106460,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,2.5.22,SPEED,What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
106461,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,2.5.23,LAUNCE,"What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My"
106462,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,2.5.24,LAUNCE,staff understands me.
106463,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.5.25,SPEED,What thou sayest?
106464,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,2.5.26,LAUNCE,"Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,"
106465,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,2.5.27,LAUNCE,and my staff understands me.
106466,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.5.28,SPEED,"It stands under thee, indeed."
106467,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,2.5.29,LAUNCE,"Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one."
106468,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,2.5.30,SPEED,"But tell me true, will't be a match?"
106469,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.5.31,LAUNCE,"Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,"
106470,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.5.32,LAUNCE,"it will, if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will."
106471,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.5.33,SPEED,The conclusion is then that it will.
106472,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,2.5.34,LAUNCE,Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
106473,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.5.35,SPEED,"'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest"
106474,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.5.36,SPEED,"thou, that my master is become a notable lover?"
106475,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,2.5.37,LAUNCE,I never knew him otherwise.
106476,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.5.38,SPEED,Than how?
106477,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,2.5.39,LAUNCE,"A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be."
106478,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,2.5.40,SPEED,"Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me."
106479,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,2.5.41,LAUNCE,"Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master."
106480,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,2.5.42,SPEED,"I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover."
106481,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.5.43,LAUNCE,"Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself"
106482,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.5.44,LAUNCE,"in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse,"
106483,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.5.45,LAUNCE,"if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the"
106484,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.5.46,LAUNCE,name of a Christian.
106485,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,2.5.47,SPEED,Why?
106486,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,2.5.48,LAUNCE,Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
106487,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,2.5.49,LAUNCE,go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
106488,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,2.5.50,SPEED,At thy service.
106489,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,,SPEED,Exeunt
106490,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,,SPEED,SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.
106491,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,,SPEED,Enter PROTEUS
106492,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.1,PROTEUS,"To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn,"
106493,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.2,PROTEUS,"To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn,"
106494,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.3,PROTEUS,"To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn,"
106495,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.4,PROTEUS,And even that power which gave me first my oath
106496,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.5,PROTEUS,"Provokes me to this threefold perjury,"
106497,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.6,PROTEUS,Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
106498,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.7,PROTEUS,"O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,"
106499,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.8,PROTEUS,"Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!"
106500,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.9,PROTEUS,"At first I did adore a twinkling star,"
106501,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.10,PROTEUS,But now I worship a celestial sun.
106502,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.11,PROTEUS,"Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,"
106503,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.12,PROTEUS,And he wants wit that wants resolved will
106504,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.13,PROTEUS,To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
106505,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.14,PROTEUS,"Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,"
106506,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.15,PROTEUS,Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
106507,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.16,PROTEUS,With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
106508,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.17,PROTEUS,"I cannot leave to love, and yet I do,"
106509,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.18,PROTEUS,But there I leave to love where I should love.
106510,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.19,PROTEUS,Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
106511,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.20,PROTEUS,"If I keep them, I needs must lose myself,"
106512,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.21,PROTEUS,"If I lose them, thus find I by their loss"
106513,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.22,PROTEUS,"For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia."
106514,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.23,PROTEUS,"I to myself am dearer than a friend,"
106515,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.24,PROTEUS,"For love is still most precious in itself,"
106516,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.25,PROTEUS,"And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--"
106517,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.26,PROTEUS,Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
106518,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.27,PROTEUS,"I will forget that Julia is alive,"
106519,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.28,PROTEUS,"Remembering that my love to her is dead,"
106520,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.29,PROTEUS,"And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,"
106521,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.30,PROTEUS,Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
106522,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.31,PROTEUS,"I cannot now prove constant to myself,"
106523,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.32,PROTEUS,Without some treachery used to Valentine.
106524,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.33,PROTEUS,This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
106525,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.34,PROTEUS,"To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,"
106526,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.35,PROTEUS,"Myself in counsel, his competitor."
106527,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.36,PROTEUS,Now presently I'll give her father notice
106528,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.37,PROTEUS,"Of their disguising and pretended flight,"
106529,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.38,PROTEUS,"Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine,"
106530,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.39,PROTEUS,"For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter,"
106531,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.40,PROTEUS,"But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross"
106532,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.41,PROTEUS,By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
106533,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.42,PROTEUS,"Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,"
106534,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.43,PROTEUS,As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
106535,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
106536,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,PROTEUS,SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.
106537,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,PROTEUS,Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
106538,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.1,JULIA,"Counsel, Lucetta, gentle girl, assist me,"
106539,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.2,JULIA,"And even in kind love I do conjure thee,"
106540,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.3,JULIA,Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
106541,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.4,JULIA,"Are visibly character'd and engraved,"
106542,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.5,JULIA,To lesson me and tell me some good mean
106543,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.6,JULIA,"How, with my honour, I may undertake"
106544,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.7,JULIA,A journey to my loving Proteus.
106545,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.7.8,LUCETTA,"Alas, the way is wearisome and long!"
106546,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.9,JULIA,A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
106547,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.10,JULIA,"To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps,"
106548,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.11,JULIA,"Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,"
106549,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.12,JULIA,"And when the flight is made to one so dear,"
106550,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.13,JULIA,"Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus."
106551,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,2.7.14,LUCETTA,Better forbear till Proteus make return.
106552,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.15,JULIA,"O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?"
106553,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.16,JULIA,"Pity the dearth that I have pined in,"
106554,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.17,JULIA,By longing for that food so long a time.
106555,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.18,JULIA,"Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,"
106556,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.19,JULIA,Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
106557,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.20,JULIA,As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
106558,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,2.7.21,LUCETTA,"I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,"
106559,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,2.7.22,LUCETTA,"But qualify the fire's extreme rage,"
106560,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,2.7.23,LUCETTA,Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
106561,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.24,JULIA,"The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns."
106562,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.25,JULIA,"The current that with gentle murmur glides,"
106563,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.26,JULIA,"Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage,"
106564,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.27,JULIA,"But when his fair course is not hindered,"
106565,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.28,JULIA,"He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,"
106566,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.29,JULIA,Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
106567,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.30,JULIA,"He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,"
106568,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.31,JULIA,And so by many winding nooks he strays
106569,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.32,JULIA,With willing sport to the wild ocean.
106570,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.33,JULIA,Then let me go and hinder not my course
106571,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.34,JULIA,I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
106572,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.35,JULIA,"And make a pastime of each weary step,"
106573,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.36,JULIA,"Till the last step have brought me to my love,"
106574,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.37,JULIA,"And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil"
106575,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.38,JULIA,A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
106576,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,2.7.39,LUCETTA,But in what habit will you go along?
106577,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.7.40,JULIA,"Not like a woman, for I would prevent"
106578,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.7.41,JULIA,The loose encounters of lascivious men:
106579,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.7.42,JULIA,"Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds"
106580,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.7.43,JULIA,As may beseem some well-reputed page.
106581,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,2.7.44,LUCETTA,"Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair."
106582,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.7.45,JULIA,"No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings"
106583,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.7.46,JULIA,With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
106584,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.7.47,JULIA,To be fantastic may become a youth
106585,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.7.48,JULIA,Of greater time than I shall show to be.
106586,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,2.7.49,LUCETTA,"What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?"
106587,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,2.7.50,JULIA,"That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,"
106588,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,2.7.51,JULIA,What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
106589,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,2.7.52,JULIA,"Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta."
106590,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,2.7.53,LUCETTA,"You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam."
106591,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.7.54,JULIA,"Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd."
106592,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,2.7.55,LUCETTA,"A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,"
106593,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,2.7.56,LUCETTA,Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
106594,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.57,JULIA,"Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have"
106595,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.58,JULIA,What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
106596,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.59,JULIA,"But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me"
106597,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.60,JULIA,For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
106598,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.61,JULIA,"I fear me, it will make me scandalized."
106599,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,2.7.62,LUCETTA,"If you think so, then stay at home and go not."
106600,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,2.7.63,JULIA,"Nay, that I will not."
106601,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.7.64,LUCETTA,"Then never dream on infamy, but go."
106602,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.7.65,LUCETTA,"If Proteus like your journey when you come,"
106603,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.7.66,LUCETTA,No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
106604,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.7.67,LUCETTA,"I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal."
106605,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.7.68,JULIA,"That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:"
106606,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.7.69,JULIA,"A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears"
106607,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.7.70,JULIA,And instances of infinite of love
106608,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.7.71,JULIA,Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
106609,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,2.7.72,LUCETTA,All these are servants to deceitful men.
106610,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.73,JULIA,"Base men, that use them to so base effect!"
106611,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.74,JULIA,But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
106612,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.75,JULIA,"His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,"
106613,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.76,JULIA,"His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,"
106614,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.77,JULIA,"His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,"
106615,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.78,JULIA,His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
106616,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,2.7.79,LUCETTA,"Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!"
106617,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.80,JULIA,"Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong"
106618,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.81,JULIA,To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
106619,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.82,JULIA,"Only deserve my love by loving him,"
106620,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.83,JULIA,"And presently go with me to my chamber,"
106621,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.84,JULIA,"To take a note of what I stand in need of,"
106622,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.85,JULIA,To furnish me upon my longing journey.
106623,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.86,JULIA,"All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,"
106624,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.87,JULIA,"My goods, my lands, my reputation,"
106625,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.88,JULIA,"Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence."
106626,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.89,JULIA,"Come, answer not, but to it presently!"
106627,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.90,JULIA,I am impatient of my tarriance.
106628,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,,JULIA,Exeunt
106629,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,,JULIA,ACT III
106630,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,,JULIA,SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.
106631,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,,JULIA,"Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS"
106632,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,3.1.1,DUKE,"Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile,"
106633,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,3.1.2,DUKE,We have some secrets to confer about.
106634,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,DUKE,Exit THURIO
106635,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,3.1.3,DUKE,"Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?"
106636,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.4,PROTEUS,"My gracious lord, that which I would discover"
106637,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.5,PROTEUS,"The law of friendship bids me to conceal,"
106638,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.6,PROTEUS,But when I call to mind your gracious favours
106639,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.7,PROTEUS,"Done to me, undeserving as I am,"
106640,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.8,PROTEUS,My duty pricks me on to utter that
106641,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.9,PROTEUS,Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
106642,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.10,PROTEUS,"Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,"
106643,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.11,PROTEUS,This night intends to steal away your daughter:
106644,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.12,PROTEUS,Myself am one made privy to the plot.
106645,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.13,PROTEUS,I know you have determined to bestow her
106646,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.14,PROTEUS,"On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,"
106647,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.15,PROTEUS,"And should she thus be stol'n away from you,"
106648,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.16,PROTEUS,It would be much vexation to your age.
106649,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.17,PROTEUS,"Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose"
106650,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.18,PROTEUS,To cross my friend in his intended drift
106651,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.19,PROTEUS,"Than, by concealing it, heap on your head"
106652,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.20,PROTEUS,"A pack of sorrows which would press you down,"
106653,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.21,PROTEUS,"Being unprevented, to your timeless grave."
106654,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.22,DUKE,"Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,"
106655,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.23,DUKE,"Which to requite, command me while I live."
106656,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.24,DUKE,"This love of theirs myself have often seen,"
106657,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.25,DUKE,"Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,"
106658,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.26,DUKE,And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
106659,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.27,DUKE,Sir Valentine her company and my court:
106660,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.28,DUKE,But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
106661,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.29,DUKE,"And so unworthily disgrace the man,"

106733,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.99,VALENTINE,"For why, the fools are mad, if left alone."
106734,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.100,VALENTINE,"Take no repulse, whatever she doth say,"
106735,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.101,VALENTINE,"For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'"
106736,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.102,VALENTINE,"Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces,"
106737,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.103,VALENTINE,"Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces."
106738,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.104,VALENTINE,"That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,"
106739,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.105,VALENTINE,If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.

106761,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,3.1.127,DUKE,"But, hark thee, I will go to her alone:"
106762,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,3.1.128,DUKE,How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
106763,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,3.1.129,VALENTINE,"It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it"
106764,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,3.1.130,VALENTINE,Under a cloak that is of any length.
106765,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,3.1.131,DUKE,A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
106766,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,3.1.132,VALENTINE,"Ay, my good lord."

106808,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.172,VALENTINE,"To die is to be banish'd from myself,"
106809,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.173,VALENTINE,And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
106810,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.174,VALENTINE,Is self from self: a deadly banishment!

106812,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.176,VALENTINE,"What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?"
106813,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.177,VALENTINE,Unless it be to think that she is by
106814,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.178,VALENTINE,And feed upon the shadow of perfection
106815,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.179,VALENTINE,"Except I be by Silvia in the night,"
106816,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.180,VALENTINE,"There is no music in the nightingale,"
106817,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.181,VALENTINE,"Unless I look on Silvia in the day,"
106818,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.182,VALENTINE,"There is no day for me to look upon,"
106819,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.183,VALENTINE,"She is my essence, and I leave to be,"
106820,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.184,VALENTINE,If I be not by her fair influence
106821,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.185,VALENTINE,"Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive."

106828,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,3.1.191,PROTEUS,What seest thou?
106829,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,3.1.192,LAUNCE,Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head

106842,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,3.1.205,PROTEUS,"Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word."
106843,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,3.1.206,VALENTINE,"My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,"
106844,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,3.1.207,VALENTINE,So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
106845,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,3.1.208,PROTEUS,"Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,"
106846,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,3.1.209,PROTEUS,"For they are harsh, untuneable and bad."
106847,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,3.1.210,VALENTINE,Is Silvia dead?
106848,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,3.1.211,PROTEUS,"No, Valentine."
106849,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,3.1.212,VALENTINE,"No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia."

106852,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,3.1.215,VALENTINE,"No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me."
106853,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,3.1.216,VALENTINE,What is your news?
106854,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,3.1.217,LAUNCE,"Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished."
106855,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,3.1.218,PROTEUS,"That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--"
106856,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,3.1.219,PROTEUS,"From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend."
106857,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,3.1.220,VALENTINE,"O, I have fed upon this woe already,"
106858,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,3.1.221,VALENTINE,And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
106859,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,3.1.222,VALENTINE,Doth Silvia know that I am banished?

107045,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.2.28,DUKE,"Ay, and perversely she persevers so."
107046,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.2.29,DUKE,What might we do to make the girl forget
107047,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.2.30,DUKE,The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?

107057,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.2.40,PROTEUS,"'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,"
107058,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.2.41,PROTEUS,Especially against his very friend.
107059,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.2.42,DUKE,"Where your good word cannot advantage him,"
107060,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.2.43,DUKE,"Your slander never can endamage him,"
107061,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.2.44,DUKE,"Therefore the office is indifferent,"
107062,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.2.45,DUKE,Being entreated to it by your friend.
107063,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.46,PROTEUS,"You have prevail'd, my lord, if I can do it"
107064,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.47,PROTEUS,"By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,"
107065,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.48,PROTEUS,She shall not long continue love to him.
107066,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.49,PROTEUS,"But say this weed her love from Valentine,"
107067,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.50,PROTEUS,It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
107068,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.51,THURIO,"Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,"
107069,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.52,THURIO,"Lest it should ravel and be good to none,"
107070,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.53,THURIO,"You must provide to bottom it on me,"
107071,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.54,THURIO,Which must be done by praising me as much
107072,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.55,THURIO,As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
107073,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.56,DUKE,"And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,"
107074,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.57,DUKE,"Because we know, on Valentine's report,"
107075,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.58,DUKE,You are already Love's firm votary
107076,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.59,DUKE,And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
107077,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.60,DUKE,Upon this warrant shall you have access
107078,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.61,DUKE,"Where you with Silvia may confer at large,"
107079,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.62,DUKE,"For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,"
107080,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.63,DUKE,"And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you,"
107081,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.64,DUKE,Where you may temper her by your persuasion
107082,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.65,DUKE,To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
107083,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.66,PROTEUS,"As much as I can do, I will effect:"
107084,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.67,PROTEUS,"But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough,"
107085,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.68,PROTEUS,You must lay lime to tangle her desires
107086,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.69,PROTEUS,"By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes"
107087,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.70,PROTEUS,Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
107088,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,3.2.71,DUKE,"Ay,"
107089,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,3.2.72,DUKE,Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
107090,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.73,PROTEUS,Say that upon the altar of her beauty
107091,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.74,PROTEUS,"You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:"
107092,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.75,PROTEUS,"Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears"
107093,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.76,PROTEUS,"Moist it again, and frame some feeling line"
107094,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.77,PROTEUS,That may discover such integrity:
107095,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.78,PROTEUS,"For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,"
107096,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.79,PROTEUS,"Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,"
107097,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.80,PROTEUS,Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
107098,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.81,PROTEUS,Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
107099,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.82,PROTEUS,"After your dire-lamenting elegies,"
107100,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.83,PROTEUS,Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
107101,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.84,PROTEUS,"With some sweet concert, to their instruments"
107102,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.85,PROTEUS,Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
107103,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.86,PROTEUS,Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
107104,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.87,PROTEUS,"This, or else nothing, will inherit her."
107105,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,3.2.88,DUKE,This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
107106,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.89,THURIO,And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
107107,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.90,THURIO,"Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,"
107108,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.91,THURIO,Let us into the city presently
107109,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.92,THURIO,To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
107110,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.93,THURIO,I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
107111,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.94,THURIO,To give the onset to thy good advice.
107112,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,3.2.95,DUKE,"About it, gentlemen!"
107113,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,3.2.96,PROTEUS,"We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,"
107114,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,3.2.97,PROTEUS,And afterward determine our proceedings.
107115,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,3.2.98,DUKE,Even now about it! I will pardon you.

107121,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,4.1.2,Second Outlaw,"If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em."

107125,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,4.1.5,SPEED,"Sir, we are undone, these are the villains"
107126,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,4.1.6,SPEED,That all the travellers do fear so much.
107127,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,4.1.7,VALENTINE,"My friends,--"
107128,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,4.1.8,First Outlaw,"That's not so, sir: we are your enemies."
107129,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,4.1.9,Second Outlaw,Peace! we'll hear him.
107130,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,4.1.10,Third Outlaw,"Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man."
107131,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.1.11,VALENTINE,Then know that I have little wealth to lose:

107133,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.1.13,VALENTINE,"My riches are these poor habiliments,"
107134,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.1.14,VALENTINE,"Of which if you should here disfurnish me,"
107135,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.1.15,VALENTINE,You take the sum and substance that I have.
107136,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,4.1.16,Second Outlaw,Whither travel you?
107137,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,4.1.17,VALENTINE,To Verona.
107138,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.1.18,First Outlaw,Whence came you?

107140,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,4.1.20,Third Outlaw,Have you long sojourned there?
107141,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,4.1.21,VALENTINE,"Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,"
107142,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,4.1.22,VALENTINE,If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
107143,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,4.1.23,First Outlaw,"What, were you banish'd thence?"
107144,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.1.24,VALENTINE,I was.
107145,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,4.1.25,Second Outlaw,For what offence?
107146,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.1.26,VALENTINE,For that which now torments me to rehearse:
107147,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.1.27,VALENTINE,"I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent,"
107148,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.1.28,VALENTINE,"Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,"
107149,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.1.29,VALENTINE,Without false vantage or base treachery.
107150,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.1.30,First Outlaw,"Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so."
107151,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.1.31,First Outlaw,But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
107152,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.1.32,VALENTINE,"I was, and held me glad of such a doom."
107153,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,4.1.33,Second Outlaw,Have you the tongues?
107154,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,4.1.34,VALENTINE,"My youthful travel therein made me happy,"
107155,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,4.1.35,VALENTINE,Or else I often had been miserable.
107156,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,4.1.36,Third Outlaw,"By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,"
107157,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,4.1.37,Third Outlaw,This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
107158,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,4.1.38,First Outlaw,"We'll have him. Sirs, a word."

107160,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,4.1.40,VALENTINE,"Peace, villain!"
107161,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.1.41,Second Outlaw,Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
107162,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.1.42,VALENTINE,Nothing but my fortune.
107163,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.43,Third Outlaw,"Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,"
107164,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.44,Third Outlaw,Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
107165,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.45,Third Outlaw,Thrust from the company of awful men:
107166,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.46,Third Outlaw,Myself was from Verona banished
107167,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.47,Third Outlaw,"For practising to steal away a lady,"

107171,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.51,First Outlaw,"And I for such like petty crimes as these,"
107172,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.52,First Outlaw,"But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,"
107173,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.53,First Outlaw,"That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives,"
107174,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.54,First Outlaw,"And partly, seeing you are beautified"
107175,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.55,First Outlaw,With goodly shape and by your own report
107176,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.56,First Outlaw,A linguist and a man of such perfection
107177,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.57,First Outlaw,As we do in our quality much want--
107178,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.58,Second Outlaw,"Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,"
107179,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.59,Second Outlaw,"Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:"
107180,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.60,Second Outlaw,Are you content to be our general?
107181,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.61,Second Outlaw,To make a virtue of necessity
107182,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.62,Second Outlaw,"And live, as we do, in this wilderness?"
107183,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.1.63,Third Outlaw,What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
107184,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.1.64,Third Outlaw,"Say ay, and be the captain of us all:"
107185,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.1.65,Third Outlaw,"We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,"
107186,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.1.66,Third Outlaw,Love thee as our commander and our king.
107187,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,4.1.67,First Outlaw,"But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest."
107188,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,4.1.68,Second Outlaw,Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
107189,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.1.69,VALENTINE,"I take your offer and will live with you,"
107190,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.1.70,VALENTINE,Provided that you do no outrages
107191,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.1.71,VALENTINE,On silly women or poor passengers.
107192,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,4.1.72,Third Outlaw,"No, we detest such vile base practises."
107193,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,4.1.73,Third Outlaw,"Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,"
107194,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,4.1.74,Third Outlaw,"And show thee all the treasure we have got,"

107199,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.1,PROTEUS,Already have I been false to Valentine
107200,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.2,PROTEUS,And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
107201,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.3,PROTEUS,"Under the colour of commending him,"
107202,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.4,PROTEUS,I have access my own love to prefer:
107203,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.5,PROTEUS,"But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,"
107204,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.6,PROTEUS,To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
107205,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.7,PROTEUS,"When I protest true loyalty to her,"
107206,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.8,PROTEUS,"She twits me with my falsehood to my friend,"
107207,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.9,PROTEUS,"When to her beauty I commend my vows,"
107208,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.10,PROTEUS,She bids me think how I have been forsworn
107209,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.11,PROTEUS,In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
107210,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.12,PROTEUS,"And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,"
107211,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.13,PROTEUS,"The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,"
107212,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.14,PROTEUS,"Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,"
107213,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.15,PROTEUS,The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
107214,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.16,PROTEUS,"But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,"

107264,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,4.2.63,JULIA,"Ay, I would I were deaf, it makes me have a slow heart."
107265,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,4.2.64,Host,I perceive you delight not in music.
107266,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,4.2.65,JULIA,"Not a whit, when it jars so."

107411,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.8,LAUNCE,and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
107412,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.9,LAUNCE,steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:

107421,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.18,LAUNCE,gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had

107423,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.20,LAUNCE,all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says

107432,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.29,LAUNCE,of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
107433,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.30,LAUNCE,"his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the"

107439,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.36,LAUNCE,Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
107440,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.37,LAUNCE,do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
107441,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.38,LAUNCE,water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst

107474,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.68,PROTEUS,"Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:"
107475,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.69,PROTEUS,"Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee."
107476,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.70,PROTEUS,"Go presently and take this ring with thee,"
107477,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.71,PROTEUS,Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
107478,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.72,PROTEUS,She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
107479,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,4.4.73,JULIA,"It seems you loved not her, to leave her token."
107480,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,4.4.74,JULIA,"She is dead, belike?"
107481,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,4.4.75,PROTEUS,"Not so, I think she lives."
107482,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,4.4.76,JULIA,Alas!
107483,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,4.4.77,PROTEUS,Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
107484,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.4.78,JULIA,I cannot choose
107485,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.4.79,JULIA,But pity her.
107486,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,4.4.80,PROTEUS,Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
107487,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.81,JULIA,Because methinks that she loved you as well
107488,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.82,JULIA,As you do love your lady Silvia:
107489,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.83,JULIA,"She dreams of him that has forgot her love,"
107490,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.84,JULIA,You dote on her that cares not for your love.
107491,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.85,JULIA,"'Tis pity love should be so contrary,"
107492,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.86,JULIA,And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
107493,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.87,PROTEUS,"Well, give her that ring and therewithal"
107494,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.88,PROTEUS,This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
107495,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.89,PROTEUS,I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
107496,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.90,PROTEUS,"Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,"
107497,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.91,PROTEUS,"Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary."
107498,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
107499,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.92,JULIA,How many women would do such a message?
107500,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.93,JULIA,"Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd"
107501,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.94,JULIA,A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
107502,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.95,JULIA,"Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him"
107503,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.96,JULIA,That with his very heart despiseth me?
107504,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.97,JULIA,"Because he loves her, he despiseth me,"
107505,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.98,JULIA,Because I love him I must pity him.
107506,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.99,JULIA,"This ring I gave him when he parted from me,"
107507,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.100,JULIA,"To bind him to remember my good will,"
107508,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.101,JULIA,"And now am I, unhappy messenger,"
107509,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.102,JULIA,"To plead for that which I would not obtain,"
107510,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.103,JULIA,"To carry that which I would have refused,"
107511,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.104,JULIA,To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
107512,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.105,JULIA,"I am my master's true-confirmed love,"
107513,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.106,JULIA,"But cannot be true servant to my master,"
107514,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.107,JULIA,Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
107515,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.108,JULIA,"Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly"
107516,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.109,JULIA,"As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed."
107517,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,,JULIA,"Enter SILVIA, attended"
107518,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.110,JULIA,"Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean"
107519,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.111,JULIA,To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
107520,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,4.4.112,SILVIA,"What would you with her, if that I be she?"
107521,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,4.4.113,JULIA,"If you be she, I do entreat your patience"
107522,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,4.4.114,JULIA,To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
107523,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,4.4.115,SILVIA,From whom?
107524,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,4.4.116,JULIA,"From my master, Sir Proteus, madam."
107525,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,4.4.117,SILVIA,"O, he sends you for a picture."
107526,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,4.4.118,JULIA,"Ay, madam."
107527,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.4.119,SILVIA,"Ursula, bring my picture here."
107528,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.4.120,SILVIA,"Go give your master this: tell him from me,"
107529,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.4.121,SILVIA,"One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,"
107530,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.4.122,SILVIA,Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
107531,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.4.123,JULIA,"Madam, please you peruse this letter.--"
107532,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.4.124,JULIA,"Pardon me, madam, I have unadvised"
107533,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.4.125,JULIA,Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
107534,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.4.126,JULIA,This is the letter to your ladyship.
107535,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.4.127,SILVIA,"I pray thee, let me look on that again."
107536,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,4.4.128,JULIA,"It may not be, good madam, pardon me."
107537,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.129,SILVIA,"There, hold!"
107538,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.130,SILVIA,I will not look upon your master's lines:
107539,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.131,SILVIA,I know they are stuff'd with protestations
107540,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.132,SILVIA,"And full of new-found oaths, which he will break"
107541,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.133,SILVIA,As easily as I do tear his paper.
107542,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.4.134,JULIA,"Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring."
107543,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.135,SILVIA,"The more shame for him that he sends it me,"
107544,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.136,SILVIA,For I have heard him say a thousand times
107545,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.137,SILVIA,His Julia gave it him at his departure.
107546,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.138,SILVIA,"Though his false finger have profaned the ring,"
107547,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.139,SILVIA,Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
107548,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,4.4.140,JULIA,She thanks you.
107549,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,4.4.141,SILVIA,What say'st thou?
107550,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.4.142,JULIA,"I thank you, madam, that you tender her."
107551,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.4.143,JULIA,Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
107552,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,4.4.144,SILVIA,Dost thou know her?
107553,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,4.4.145,JULIA,Almost as well as I do know myself:
107554,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,4.4.146,JULIA,To think upon her woes I do protest
107555,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,4.4.147,JULIA,That I have wept a hundred several times.
107556,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,4.4.148,SILVIA,Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
107557,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,4.4.149,JULIA,"I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow."
107558,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,4.4.150,SILVIA,Is she not passing fair?
107559,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.151,JULIA,"She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:"
107560,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.152,JULIA,"When she did think my master loved her well,"
107561,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.153,JULIA,"She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:"
107562,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.154,JULIA,But since she did neglect her looking-glass
107563,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.155,JULIA,"And threw her sun-expelling mask away,"
107564,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.156,JULIA,The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
107565,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.157,JULIA,"And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,"
107566,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.158,JULIA,That now she is become as black as I.
107567,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,4.4.159,SILVIA,How tall was she?
107568,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.160,JULIA,"About my stature, for at Pentecost,"
107569,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.161,JULIA,"When all our pageants of delight were play'd,"
107570,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.162,JULIA,"Our youth got me to play the woman's part,"
107571,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.163,JULIA,"And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,"
107572,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.164,JULIA,"Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,"
107573,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.165,JULIA,As if the garment had been made for me:
107574,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.166,JULIA,Therefore I know she is about my height.
107575,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.167,JULIA,"And at that time I made her weep agood,"
107576,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.168,JULIA,For I did play a lamentable part:
107577,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.169,JULIA,"Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning"
107578,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.170,JULIA,"For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight,"
107579,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.171,JULIA,Which I so lively acted with my tears
107580,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.172,JULIA,"That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,"
107581,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.173,JULIA,"Wept bitterly, and would I might be dead"
107582,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.174,JULIA,If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
107583,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.175,SILVIA,"She is beholding to thee, gentle youth."
107584,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.176,SILVIA,"Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!"
107585,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.177,SILVIA,I weep myself to think upon thy words.
107586,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.178,SILVIA,"Here, youth, there is my purse, I give thee this"
107587,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.179,SILVIA,"For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her."
107588,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.180,SILVIA,Farewell.
107589,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,,SILVIA,"Exit SILVIA, with attendants"
107590,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.181,JULIA,"And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her."
107591,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.182,JULIA,"A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful"
107592,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.183,JULIA,"I hope my master's suit will be but cold,"
107593,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.184,JULIA,Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
107594,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.185,JULIA,"Alas, how love can trifle with itself!"
107595,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.186,JULIA,"Here is her picture: let me see, I think,"
107596,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.187,JULIA,"If I had such a tire, this face of mine"
107597,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.188,JULIA,Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
107598,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.189,JULIA,"And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,"
107599,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.190,JULIA,Unless I flatter with myself too much.
107600,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.191,JULIA,"Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:"
107601,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.192,JULIA,"If that be all the difference in his love,"
107602,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.193,JULIA,I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
107603,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.194,JULIA,"Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:"
107604,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.195,JULIA,"Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high."
107605,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.196,JULIA,What should it be that he respects in her
107606,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.197,JULIA,"But I can make respective in myself,"
107607,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.198,JULIA,If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
107608,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.199,JULIA,"Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,"
107609,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.200,JULIA,"For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,"
107610,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.201,JULIA,"Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!"
107611,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.202,JULIA,"And, were there sense in his idolatry,"
107612,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.203,JULIA,My substance should be statue in thy stead.
107613,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.204,JULIA,"I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,"
107614,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.205,JULIA,"That used me so, or else, by Jove I vow,"
107615,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.206,JULIA,I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
107616,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.207,JULIA,To make my master out of love with thee!
107617,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,,JULIA,Exit
107618,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,,JULIA,ACT V
107619,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,,JULIA,SCENE I. Milan. An abbey.
107620,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,,JULIA,Enter EGLAMOUR
107621,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.1,EGLAMOUR,"The sun begins to gild the western sky,"
107622,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.2,EGLAMOUR,And now it is about the very hour
107623,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.3,EGLAMOUR,"That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me."
107624,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.4,EGLAMOUR,"She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,"
107625,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.5,EGLAMOUR,"Unless it be to come before their time,"
107626,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.6,EGLAMOUR,So much they spur their expedition.
107627,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.7,EGLAMOUR,See where she comes.
107628,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,EGLAMOUR,Enter SILVIA
107629,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.8,EGLAMOUR,"Lady, a happy evening!"
107630,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.1.9,SILVIA,"Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,"
107631,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.1.10,SILVIA,Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
107632,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.1.11,SILVIA,I fear I am attended by some spies.
107633,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.1.12,EGLAMOUR,"Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off,"
107634,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.1.13,EGLAMOUR,"If we recover that, we are sure enough."
107635,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,,EGLAMOUR,Exeunt
107636,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,,EGLAMOUR,SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.
107637,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,,EGLAMOUR,"Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA"
107638,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.2.1,THURIO,"Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?"
107639,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.2.2,PROTEUS,"O, sir, I find her milder than she was,"
107640,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.2.3,PROTEUS,And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
107641,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.2.4,THURIO,"What, that my leg is too long?"
107642,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,5.2.5,PROTEUS,"No, that it is too little."
107643,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.2.6,THURIO,"I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder."
107644,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.2.7,JULIA,[Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what
107645,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.2.8,JULIA,it loathes.
107646,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,5.2.9,THURIO,What says she to my face?
107647,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.2.10,PROTEUS,She says it is a fair one.
107648,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.2.11,THURIO,"Nay then, the wanton lies, my face is black."
107649,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.2.12,PROTEUS,"But pearls are fair, and the old saying is,"
107650,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.2.13,PROTEUS,Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
107651,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.2.14,JULIA,"[Aside]  'Tis true, such pearls as put out"
107652,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.2.15,JULIA,"ladies' eyes,"
107653,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.2.16,JULIA,For I had rather wink than look on them.
107654,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,5.2.17,THURIO,How likes she my discourse?
107655,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.2.18,PROTEUS,"Ill, when you talk of war."
107656,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,5.2.19,THURIO,"But well, when I discourse of love and peace?"
107657,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,5.2.20,JULIA,"[Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace."
107658,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,5.2.21,THURIO,What says she to my valour?
107659,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,5.2.22,PROTEUS,"O, sir, she makes no doubt of that."
107660,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.2.23,JULIA,"[Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice."
107661,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.2.24,THURIO,What says she to my birth?
107662,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.2.25,PROTEUS,That you are well derived.
107663,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,5.2.26,JULIA,"[Aside]  True, from a gentleman to a fool."
107664,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,5.2.27,THURIO,Considers she my possessions?
107665,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,5.2.28,PROTEUS,"O, ay, and pities them."
107666,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,5.2.29,THURIO,Wherefore?
107667,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,5.2.30,JULIA,[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
107668,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,5.2.31,PROTEUS,That they are out by lease.
107669,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,5.2.32,JULIA,Here comes the duke.
107670,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,,JULIA,Enter DUKE
107671,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,5.2.33,DUKE,"How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!"
107672,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,5.2.34,DUKE,Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
107673,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,5.2.35,THURIO,Not I.
107674,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,5.2.36,PROTEUS,Nor I.
107675,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,5.2.37,DUKE,Saw you my daughter?
107676,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.2.38,PROTEUS,Neither.
107677,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.39,DUKE,"Why then,"
107678,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.40,DUKE,"She's fled unto that peasant Valentine,"
107679,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.41,DUKE,And Eglamour is in her company.
107680,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.42,DUKE,"'Tis true, for Friar Laurence met them both,"
107681,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.43,DUKE,"As he in penance wander'd through the forest,"
107682,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.44,DUKE,"Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,"
107683,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.45,DUKE,"But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it,"
107684,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.46,DUKE,"Besides, she did intend confession"
107685,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.47,DUKE,"At Patrick's cell this even, and there she was not,"
107686,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.48,DUKE,These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
107687,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.49,DUKE,"Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,"
107688,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.50,DUKE,But mount you presently and meet with me

107690,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.52,DUKE,"That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:"
107691,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.53,DUKE,"Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me."
107692,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,,DUKE,Exit
107693,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.2.54,THURIO,"Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,"
107694,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.2.55,THURIO,That flies her fortune when it follows her.
107695,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.2.56,THURIO,"I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour"
107696,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.2.57,THURIO,Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
107697,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,,THURIO,Exit
107698,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,5.2.58,PROTEUS,"And I will follow, more for Silvia's love"
107699,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,5.2.59,PROTEUS,Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
107700,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
107701,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,5.2.60,JULIA,"And I will follow, more to cross that love"
107702,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,5.2.61,JULIA,Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.

107707,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.3.2,First Outlaw,"Be patient, we must bring you to our captain."
107708,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.3.3,SILVIA,A thousand more mischances than this one
107709,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.3.4,SILVIA,Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
107710,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.3.5,Second Outlaw,"Come, bring her away."
107711,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,5.3.6,First Outlaw,Where is the gentleman that was with her?
107712,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.7,Third Outlaw,"Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,"
107713,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.8,Third Outlaw,But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
107714,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.9,Third Outlaw,"Go thou with her to the west end of the wood,"
107715,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.10,Third Outlaw,"There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled,"
107716,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.11,Third Outlaw,"The thicket is beset, he cannot 'scape."
107717,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.3.12,First Outlaw,"Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:"

107721,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,,SILVIA,Exeunt
107722,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,,SILVIA,SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.
107723,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,,SILVIA,Enter VALENTINE
107724,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.1,VALENTINE,How use doth breed a habit in a man!
107725,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.2,VALENTINE,"This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,"
107726,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.3,VALENTINE,I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
107727,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.4,VALENTINE,"Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,"
107728,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.5,VALENTINE,And to the nightingale's complaining notes
107729,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.6,VALENTINE,Tune my distresses and record my woes.
107730,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.7,VALENTINE,"O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,"
107731,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.8,VALENTINE,"Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,"
107732,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.9,VALENTINE,"Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall"
107733,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.10,VALENTINE,And leave no memory of what it was!
107734,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.11,VALENTINE,"Repair me with thy presence, Silvia,"
107735,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.12,VALENTINE,"Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!"
107736,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.13,VALENTINE,What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
107737,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.14,VALENTINE,"These are my mates, that make their wills their law,"
107738,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.15,VALENTINE,Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
107739,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.16,VALENTINE,"They love me well, yet I have much to do"
107740,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.17,VALENTINE,To keep them from uncivil outrages.
107741,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.18,VALENTINE,"Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?"
107742,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,VALENTINE,"Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA"
107743,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.19,PROTEUS,"Madam, this service I have done for you,"
107744,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.20,PROTEUS,"Though you respect not aught your servant doth,"
107745,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.21,PROTEUS,To hazard life and rescue you from him
107746,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.22,PROTEUS,"That would have forced your honour and your love,"
107747,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.23,PROTEUS,"Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look,"
107748,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.24,PROTEUS,A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
107749,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.25,PROTEUS,"And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give."
107750,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.4.26,VALENTINE,[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
107751,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.4.27,VALENTINE,"Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile."
107752,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,5.4.28,SILVIA,"O miserable, unhappy that I am!"
107753,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.4.29,PROTEUS,"Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came,"
107754,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.4.30,PROTEUS,But by my coming I have made you happy.
107755,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.4.31,SILVIA,By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
107756,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,5.4.32,JULIA,"[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence."
107757,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.33,SILVIA,"Had I been seized by a hungry lion,"
107758,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.34,SILVIA,"I would have been a breakfast to the beast,"
107759,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.35,SILVIA,Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
107760,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.36,SILVIA,"O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,"
107761,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.37,SILVIA,Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
107762,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.38,SILVIA,"And full as much, for more there cannot be,"
107763,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.39,SILVIA,I do detest false perjured Proteus.
107764,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.40,SILVIA,"Therefore be gone, solicit me no more."
107765,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.4.41,PROTEUS,"What dangerous action, stood it next to death,"
107766,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.4.42,PROTEUS,Would I not undergo for one calm look!
107767,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.4.43,PROTEUS,"O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,"
107768,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.4.44,PROTEUS,When women cannot love where they're beloved!
107769,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.45,SILVIA,When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
107770,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.46,SILVIA,"Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,"
107771,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.47,SILVIA,For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
107772,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.48,SILVIA,"Into a thousand oaths, and all those oaths"
107773,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.49,SILVIA,"Descended into perjury, to love me."
107774,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.50,SILVIA,"Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two,"
107775,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.51,SILVIA,"And that's far worse than none, better have none"
107776,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.52,SILVIA,Than plural faith which is too much by one:
107777,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.53,SILVIA,Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
107778,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.4.54,PROTEUS,In love
107779,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.4.55,PROTEUS,Who respects friend?
107780,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,5.4.56,SILVIA,All men but Proteus.
107781,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.4.57,PROTEUS,"Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words"
107782,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.4.58,PROTEUS,"Can no way change you to a milder form,"
107783,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.4.59,PROTEUS,"I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,"
107784,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.4.60,PROTEUS,"And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye."
107785,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,5.4.61,SILVIA,O heaven!
107786,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,5.4.62,PROTEUS,I'll force thee yield to my desire.
107787,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,5.4.63,VALENTINE,"Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,"
107788,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,5.4.64,VALENTINE,Thou friend of an ill fashion!
107789,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,5.4.65,PROTEUS,Valentine!
107790,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.66,VALENTINE,"Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,"
107791,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.67,VALENTINE,"For such is a friend now, treacherous man!"
107792,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.68,VALENTINE,"Thou hast beguiled my hopes, nought but mine eye"
107793,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.69,VALENTINE,Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
107794,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.70,VALENTINE,"I have one friend alive, thou wouldst disprove me."
107795,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.71,VALENTINE,"Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand"
107796,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.72,VALENTINE,"Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,"
107797,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.73,VALENTINE,"I am sorry I must never trust thee more,"
107798,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.74,VALENTINE,But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
107799,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.75,VALENTINE,"The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,"
107800,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.76,VALENTINE,'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
107801,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.77,PROTEUS,My shame and guilt confounds me.
107802,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.78,PROTEUS,"Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow"
107803,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.79,PROTEUS,"Be a sufficient ransom for offence,"
107804,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.80,PROTEUS,"I tender 't here, I do as truly suffer"
107805,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.81,PROTEUS,As e'er I did commit.
107806,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.82,VALENTINE,"Then I am paid,"
107807,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.83,VALENTINE,And once again I do receive thee honest.
107808,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.84,VALENTINE,Who by repentance is not satisfied
107809,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.85,VALENTINE,"Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased."
107810,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.86,VALENTINE,By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
107811,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.87,VALENTINE,"And, that my love may appear plain and free,"
107812,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.88,VALENTINE,All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
107813,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,5.4.89,JULIA,O me unhappy!
107814,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,,JULIA,Swoons
107815,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,5.4.90,PROTEUS,Look to the boy.
107816,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,5.4.91,VALENTINE,"Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?"
107817,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,5.4.92,VALENTINE,"Look up, speak."
107818,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,5.4.93,JULIA,"O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring"
107819,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,5.4.94,JULIA,"to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done."
107820,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,5.4.95,PROTEUS,"Where is that ring, boy?"
107821,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,5.4.96,JULIA,"Here 'tis, this is it."
107822,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,5.4.97,PROTEUS,How! let me see:
107823,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,5.4.98,PROTEUS,"Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia."
107824,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,5.4.99,JULIA,"O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:"
107825,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,5.4.100,JULIA,This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
107826,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,5.4.101,PROTEUS,But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
107827,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,5.4.102,PROTEUS,I gave this unto Julia.
107828,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,5.4.103,JULIA,"And Julia herself did give it me,"
107829,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,5.4.104,JULIA,And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
107830,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,5.4.105,PROTEUS,How! Julia!
107831,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.106,JULIA,"Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,"
107832,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.107,JULIA,And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
107833,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.108,JULIA,How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
107834,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.109,JULIA,"O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!"
107835,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.110,JULIA,Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
107836,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.111,JULIA,"Such an immodest raiment, if shame live"
107837,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.112,JULIA,In a disguise of love:
107838,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.113,JULIA,"It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,"
107839,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.114,JULIA,Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
107840,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.115,PROTEUS,Than men their minds! 'tis true.
107841,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.116,PROTEUS,O heaven! were man
107842,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.117,PROTEUS,"But constant, he were perfect. That one error"
107843,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.118,PROTEUS,"Fills him with faults, makes him run through all the sins:"
107844,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.119,PROTEUS,Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
107845,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.120,PROTEUS,"What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy"
107846,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.121,PROTEUS,More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
107847,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.4.122,VALENTINE,"Come, come, a hand from either:"
107848,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.4.123,VALENTINE,"Let me be blest to make this happy close,"
107849,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.4.124,VALENTINE,'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
107850,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,5.4.125,PROTEUS,"Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever."
107851,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,5.4.126,JULIA,And I mine.
107852,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,,JULIA,"Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO"
107853,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,5.4.127,Outlaws,"A prize, a prize, a prize!"
107854,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,5.4.128,VALENTINE,"Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke."
107855,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,5.4.129,VALENTINE,"Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,"
107856,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,5.4.130,VALENTINE,Banished Valentine.
107857,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,5.4.131,DUKE,Sir Valentine!
107858,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,5.4.132,THURIO,"Yonder is Silvia, and Silvia's mine."
107859,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.133,VALENTINE,"Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death,"
107860,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.134,VALENTINE,"Come not within the measure of my wrath,"
107861,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.135,VALENTINE,"Do not name Silvia thine, if once again,"
107862,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.136,VALENTINE,"Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands,"
107863,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.137,VALENTINE,Take but possession of her with a touch:
107864,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.138,VALENTINE,I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
107865,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,5.4.139,THURIO,"Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I,"
107866,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,5.4.140,THURIO,I hold him but a fool that will endanger
107867,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,5.4.141,THURIO,His body for a girl that loves him not:
107868,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,5.4.142,THURIO,"I claim her not, and therefore she is thine."
107869,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.143,DUKE,"The more degenerate and base art thou,"
107870,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.144,DUKE,To make such means for her as thou hast done
107871,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.145,DUKE,And leave her on such slight conditions.
107872,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.146,DUKE,"Now, by the honour of my ancestry,"
107873,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.147,DUKE,"I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,"
107874,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.148,DUKE,And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
107875,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.149,DUKE,"Know then, I here forget all former griefs,"
107876,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.150,DUKE,"Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,"
107877,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.151,DUKE,"Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,"
107878,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.152,DUKE,"To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,"
107879,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.153,DUKE,"Thou art a gentleman and well derived,"
107880,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.154,DUKE,"Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her."
107881,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,5.4.155,VALENTINE,"I thank your grace, the gift hath made me happy."
107882,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,5.4.156,VALENTINE,"I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,"
107883,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,5.4.157,VALENTINE,To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.

107914,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.1.4,ARCHIDAMUS,difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
107915,A Winters Tale,2.0,1.1.5,CAMILLO,"I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia"
107916,A Winters Tale,2.0,1.1.6,CAMILLO,means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
107917,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.1.7,ARCHIDAMUS,Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
107918,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.1.8,ARCHIDAMUS,"justified in our loves, for indeed--"
107919,A Winters Tale,4.0,1.1.9,CAMILLO,"Beseech you,--"
107920,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.10,ARCHIDAMUS,"Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:"
107921,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.11,ARCHIDAMUS,we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
107922,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.12,ARCHIDAMUS,"not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,"

107924,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.14,ARCHIDAMUS,"may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse"
107925,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.15,ARCHIDAMUS,us.
107926,A Winters Tale,6.0,1.1.16,CAMILLO,You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
107927,A Winters Tale,7.0,1.1.17,ARCHIDAMUS,"Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me"
107928,A Winters Tale,7.0,1.1.18,ARCHIDAMUS,and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
107929,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.19,CAMILLO,Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.

107940,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.30,CAMILLO,winds. The heavens continue their loves!
107941,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.1.31,ARCHIDAMUS,I think there is not in the world either malice or
107942,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.1.32,ARCHIDAMUS,matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
107943,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.1.33,ARCHIDAMUS,comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a

107945,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.1.35,ARCHIDAMUS,into my note.

107950,A Winters Tale,10.0,1.1.40,CAMILLO,see him a man.
107951,A Winters Tale,11.0,1.1.41,ARCHIDAMUS,Would they else be content to die?
107952,A Winters Tale,12.0,1.1.42,CAMILLO,"Yes, if there were no other excuse why they should"
107953,A Winters Tale,12.0,1.1.43,CAMILLO,desire to live.
107954,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.1.44,ARCHIDAMUS,"If the king had no son, they would desire to live"

108023,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.65,HERMIONE,"Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees"

108028,A Winters Tale,18.0,1.2.70,POLIXENES,"To be your prisoner should import offending,"
108029,A Winters Tale,18.0,1.2.71,POLIXENES,Which is for me less easy to commit
108030,A Winters Tale,18.0,1.2.72,POLIXENES,Than you to punish.
108031,A Winters Tale,19.0,1.2.73,HERMIONE,"Not your gaoler, then,"
108032,A Winters Tale,19.0,1.2.74,HERMIONE,"But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you"
108033,A Winters Tale,19.0,1.2.75,HERMIONE,Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
108034,A Winters Tale,19.0,1.2.76,HERMIONE,You were pretty lordings then?
108035,A Winters Tale,20.0,1.2.77,POLIXENES,"We were, fair queen,"
108036,A Winters Tale,20.0,1.2.78,POLIXENES,Two lads that thought there was no more behind
108037,A Winters Tale,20.0,1.2.79,POLIXENES,"But such a day to-morrow as to-day,"
108038,A Winters Tale,20.0,1.2.80,POLIXENES,And to be boy eternal.
108039,A Winters Tale,21.0,1.2.81,HERMIONE,Was not my lord
108040,A Winters Tale,21.0,1.2.82,HERMIONE,The verier wag o' the two?
108041,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.83,POLIXENES,"We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,"
108042,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.84,POLIXENES,And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
108043,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.85,POLIXENES,"Was innocence for innocence, we knew not"
108044,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.86,POLIXENES,"The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd"
108045,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.87,POLIXENES,"That any did. Had we pursued that life,"
108046,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.88,POLIXENES,And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
108047,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.89,POLIXENES,"With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven"
108048,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.90,POLIXENES,"Boldly 'not guilty,' the imposition clear'd"
108049,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.91,POLIXENES,Hereditary ours.
108050,A Winters Tale,23.0,1.2.92,HERMIONE,By this we gather
108051,A Winters Tale,23.0,1.2.93,HERMIONE,You have tripp'd since.
108052,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.94,POLIXENES,O my most sacred lady!
108053,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.95,POLIXENES,"Temptations have since then been born to's, for"
108054,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.96,POLIXENES,"In those unfledged days was my wife a girl,"
108055,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.97,POLIXENES,Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
108056,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.98,POLIXENES,Of my young play-fellow.
108057,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.99,HERMIONE,Grace to boot!
108058,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.100,HERMIONE,"Of this make no conclusion, lest you say"
108059,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.101,HERMIONE,"Your queen and I are devils: yet go on,"
108060,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.102,HERMIONE,"The offences we have made you do we'll answer,"
108061,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.103,HERMIONE,If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
108062,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.104,HERMIONE,You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
108063,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.105,HERMIONE,With any but with us.
108064,A Winters Tale,26.0,1.2.106,LEONTES,Is he won yet?
108065,A Winters Tale,27.0,1.2.107,HERMIONE,He'll stay my lord.
108066,A Winters Tale,28.0,1.2.108,LEONTES,At my request he would not.
108067,A Winters Tale,28.0,1.2.109,LEONTES,"Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest"
108068,A Winters Tale,28.0,1.2.110,LEONTES,To better purpose.
108069,A Winters Tale,29.0,1.2.111,HERMIONE,Never?
108070,A Winters Tale,30.0,1.2.112,LEONTES,"Never, but once."
108071,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.113,HERMIONE,What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
108072,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.114,HERMIONE,"I prithee tell me, cram's with praise, and make's"
108073,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.115,HERMIONE,As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
108074,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.116,HERMIONE,Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
108075,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.117,HERMIONE,Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
108076,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.118,HERMIONE,With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
108077,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.119,HERMIONE,With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
108078,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.120,HERMIONE,My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
108079,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.121,HERMIONE,"What was my first? it has an elder sister,"
108080,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.122,HERMIONE,"Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!"
108081,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.123,HERMIONE,But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
108082,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.124,HERMIONE,"Nay, let me have't, I long."
108083,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.125,LEONTES,"Why, that was when"
108084,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.126,LEONTES,"Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,"
108085,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.127,LEONTES,Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
108086,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.128,LEONTES,And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
108087,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.129,LEONTES,'I am yours for ever.'
108088,A Winters Tale,33.0,1.2.130,HERMIONE,'Tis grace indeed.
108089,A Winters Tale,33.0,1.2.131,HERMIONE,"Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:"
108090,A Winters Tale,33.0,1.2.132,HERMIONE,"The one for ever earn'd a royal husband,"
108091,A Winters Tale,33.0,1.2.133,HERMIONE,The other for some while a friend.
108092,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.134,LEONTES,"[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!"
108093,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.135,LEONTES,To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
108094,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.136,LEONTES,"I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances,"
108095,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.137,LEONTES,"But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment"
108096,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.138,LEONTES,"May a free face put on, derive a liberty"
108097,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.139,LEONTES,"From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,"
108098,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.140,LEONTES,"And well become the agent, 't may, I grant,"
108099,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.141,LEONTES,"But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,"
108100,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.142,LEONTES,"As now they are, and making practised smiles,"
108101,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.143,LEONTES,"As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere"
108102,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.144,LEONTES,"The mort o' the deer, O, that is entertainment"
108103,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.145,LEONTES,"My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,"
108104,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.146,LEONTES,Art thou my boy?
108105,A Winters Tale,35.0,1.2.147,MAMILLIUS,"Ay, my good lord."
108106,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.148,LEONTES,I' fecks!
108107,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.149,LEONTES,"Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast"
108108,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.150,LEONTES,smutch'd thy nose?
108109,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.151,LEONTES,"They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,"
108110,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.152,LEONTES,"We must be neat, not neat, but cleanly, captain:"
108111,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.153,LEONTES,"And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf"
108112,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.154,LEONTES,Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
108113,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.155,LEONTES,"Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!"
108114,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.156,LEONTES,Art thou my calf?
108115,A Winters Tale,37.0,1.2.157,MAMILLIUS,"Yes, if you will, my lord."
108116,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.158,LEONTES,"Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,"
108117,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.159,LEONTES,To be full like me: yet they say we are
108118,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.160,LEONTES,"Almost as like as eggs, women say so,"
108119,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.161,LEONTES,That will say anything but were they false
108120,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.162,LEONTES,"As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false"
108121,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.163,LEONTES,As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
108122,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.164,LEONTES,"No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true"
108123,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.165,LEONTES,"To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,"
108124,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.166,LEONTES,Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
108125,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.167,LEONTES,Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
108126,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.168,LEONTES,Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
108127,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.169,LEONTES,"Thou dost make possible things not so held,"
108128,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.170,LEONTES,"Communicatest with dreams,--how can this be?--"
108129,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.171,LEONTES,"With what's unreal thou coactive art,"
108130,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.172,LEONTES,And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
108131,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.173,LEONTES,"Thou mayst co-join with something, and thou dost,"
108132,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.174,LEONTES,"And that beyond commission, and I find it,"
108133,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.175,LEONTES,And that to the infection of my brains
108134,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.176,LEONTES,And hardening of my brows.
108135,A Winters Tale,39.0,1.2.177,POLIXENES,What means Sicilia?
108136,A Winters Tale,40.0,1.2.178,HERMIONE,He something seems unsettled.
108137,A Winters Tale,41.0,1.2.179,POLIXENES,"How, my lord!"
108138,A Winters Tale,41.0,1.2.180,POLIXENES,"What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?"
108139,A Winters Tale,42.0,1.2.181,HERMIONE,You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
108140,A Winters Tale,42.0,1.2.182,HERMIONE,"Are you moved, my lord?"
108141,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.183,LEONTES,"No, in good earnest."
108142,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.184,LEONTES,"How sometimes nature will betray its folly,"
108143,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.185,LEONTES,"Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime"
108144,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.186,LEONTES,To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
108145,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.187,LEONTES,"Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil"
108146,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.188,LEONTES,"Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,"
108147,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.189,LEONTES,"In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,"
108148,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.190,LEONTES,"Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,"
108149,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.191,LEONTES,"As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:"
108150,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.192,LEONTES,"How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,"
108151,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.193,LEONTES,"This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,"
108152,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.194,LEONTES,Will you take eggs for money?
108153,A Winters Tale,44.0,1.2.195,MAMILLIUS,"No, my lord, I'll fight."
108154,A Winters Tale,45.0,1.2.196,LEONTES,"You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,"
108155,A Winters Tale,45.0,1.2.197,LEONTES,Are you so fond of your young prince as we
108156,A Winters Tale,45.0,1.2.198,LEONTES,Do seem to be of ours?
108157,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.199,POLIXENES,"If at home, sir,"
108158,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.200,POLIXENES,"He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,"
108159,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.201,POLIXENES,"Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,"
108160,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.202,POLIXENES,"My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:"
108161,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.203,POLIXENES,"He makes a July's day short as December,"
108162,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.204,POLIXENES,And with his varying childness cures in me
108163,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.205,POLIXENES,Thoughts that would thick my blood.
108164,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.206,LEONTES,So stands this squire
108165,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.207,LEONTES,"Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,"
108166,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.208,LEONTES,"And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,"
108167,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.209,LEONTES,"How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome,"
108168,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.210,LEONTES,Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
108169,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.211,LEONTES,"Next to thyself and my young rover, he's"
108170,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.212,LEONTES,Apparent to my heart.
108171,A Winters Tale,48.0,1.2.213,HERMIONE,"If you would seek us,"
108172,A Winters Tale,48.0,1.2.214,HERMIONE,We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
108173,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.215,LEONTES,"To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,"
108174,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.216,LEONTES,Be you beneath the sky.
108175,A Winters Tale,49.0,,LEONTES,Aside
108176,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.217,LEONTES,"I am angling now,"
108177,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.218,LEONTES,Though you perceive me not how I give line.
108178,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.219,LEONTES,"Go to, go to!"
108179,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.220,LEONTES,"How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!"
108180,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.221,LEONTES,And arms her with the boldness of a wife
108181,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.222,LEONTES,To her allowing husband!
108182,A Winters Tale,49.0,,LEONTES,"Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants"
108183,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.223,LEONTES,Gone already!
108184,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.224,LEONTES,"Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and"
108185,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.225,LEONTES,ears a fork'd one!
108186,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.226,LEONTES,"Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I"
108187,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.227,LEONTES,"Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue"
108188,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.228,LEONTES,Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
108189,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.229,LEONTES,"Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play."
108190,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.230,LEONTES,"There have been,"
108191,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.231,LEONTES,"Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now,"
108192,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.232,LEONTES,"And many a man there is, even at this present,"
108193,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.233,LEONTES,"Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,"
108194,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.234,LEONTES,That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
108195,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.235,LEONTES,"And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by"
108196,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.236,LEONTES,"Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't"
108197,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.237,LEONTES,"Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,"
108198,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.238,LEONTES,"As mine, against their will. Should all despair"
108199,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.239,LEONTES,"That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind"
108200,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.240,LEONTES,"Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none,"
108201,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.241,LEONTES,"It is a bawdy planet, that will strike"
108202,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.242,LEONTES,"Where 'tis predominant, and 'tis powerful, think it,"
108203,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.243,LEONTES,"From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,"
108204,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.244,LEONTES,"No barricado for a belly, know't,"
108205,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.245,LEONTES,It will let in and out the enemy
108206,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.246,LEONTES,With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
108207,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.247,LEONTES,"Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!"
108208,A Winters Tale,50.0,1.2.248,MAMILLIUS,"I am like you, they say."
108209,A Winters Tale,51.0,1.2.249,LEONTES,"Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?"
108210,A Winters Tale,52.0,1.2.250,CAMILLO,"Ay, my good lord."
108211,A Winters Tale,53.0,1.2.251,LEONTES,"Go play, Mamillius, thou'rt an honest man."
108212,A Winters Tale,53.0,,LEONTES,Exit MAMILLIUS
108213,A Winters Tale,53.0,1.2.252,LEONTES,"Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer."
108214,A Winters Tale,54.0,1.2.253,CAMILLO,You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
108215,A Winters Tale,54.0,1.2.254,CAMILLO,"When you cast out, it still came home."
108216,A Winters Tale,55.0,1.2.255,LEONTES,Didst note it?
108217,A Winters Tale,56.0,1.2.256,CAMILLO,He would not stay at your petitions: made
108218,A Winters Tale,56.0,1.2.257,CAMILLO,His business more material.
108219,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.258,LEONTES,Didst perceive it?
108220,A Winters Tale,57.0,,LEONTES,Aside
108221,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.259,LEONTES,"They're here with me already, whispering, rounding"
108222,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.260,LEONTES,"'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,"
108223,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.261,LEONTES,"When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,"
108224,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.262,LEONTES,That he did stay?
108225,A Winters Tale,58.0,1.2.263,CAMILLO,At the good queen's entreaty.
108226,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.264,LEONTES,At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
108227,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.265,LEONTES,"But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken"
108228,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.266,LEONTES,By any understanding pate but thine?
108229,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.267,LEONTES,"For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in"
108230,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.268,LEONTES,"More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,"
108231,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.269,LEONTES,But of the finer natures? by some severals
108232,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.270,LEONTES,Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
108233,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.271,LEONTES,Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
108234,A Winters Tale,60.0,1.2.272,CAMILLO,"Business, my lord! I think most understand"
108235,A Winters Tale,60.0,1.2.273,CAMILLO,Bohemia stays here longer.
108236,A Winters Tale,61.0,1.2.274,LEONTES,Ha!
108237,A Winters Tale,62.0,1.2.275,CAMILLO,Stays here longer.
108238,A Winters Tale,63.0,1.2.276,LEONTES,"Ay, but why?"
108239,A Winters Tale,64.0,1.2.277,CAMILLO,To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
108240,A Winters Tale,64.0,1.2.278,CAMILLO,Of our most gracious mistress.
108241,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.279,LEONTES,Satisfy!
108242,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.280,LEONTES,The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
108243,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.281,LEONTES,"Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,"
108244,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.282,LEONTES,"With all the nearest things to my heart, as well"
108245,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.283,LEONTES,"My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou"
108246,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.284,LEONTES,"Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed"
108247,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.285,LEONTES,Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
108248,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.286,LEONTES,"Deceived in thy integrity, deceived"
108249,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.287,LEONTES,In that which seems so.
108250,A Winters Tale,66.0,1.2.288,CAMILLO,"Be it forbid, my lord!"
108251,A Winters Tale,67.0,1.2.289,LEONTES,"To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,"
108252,A Winters Tale,67.0,1.2.290,LEONTES,"If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,"
108253,A Winters Tale,67.0,1.2.291,LEONTES,"Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining"
108254,A Winters Tale,67.0,1.2.292,LEONTES,"From course required, or else thou must be counted"
108255,A Winters Tale,67.0,1.2.293,LEONTES,A servant grafted in my serious trust
108256,A Winters Tale,67.0,1.2.294,LEONTES,"And therein negligent, or else a fool"
108257,A Winters Tale,67.0,1.2.295,LEONTES,"That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,"
108258,A Winters Tale,67.0,1.2.296,LEONTES,And takest it all for jest.
108259,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.297,CAMILLO,"My gracious lord,"
108260,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.298,CAMILLO,"I may be negligent, foolish and fearful,"
108261,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.299,CAMILLO,"In every one of these no man is free,"
108262,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.300,CAMILLO,"But that his negligence, his folly, fear,"
108263,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.301,CAMILLO,"Among the infinite doings of the world,"
108264,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.302,CAMILLO,"Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,"
108265,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.303,CAMILLO,"If ever I were wilful-negligent,"
108266,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.304,CAMILLO,"It was my folly, if industriously"
108267,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.305,CAMILLO,"I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,"
108268,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.306,CAMILLO,"Not weighing well the end, if ever fearful"
108269,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.307,CAMILLO,"To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,"
108270,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.308,CAMILLO,Where of the execution did cry out
108271,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.309,CAMILLO,"Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear"
108272,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.310,CAMILLO,"Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,"
108273,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.311,CAMILLO,Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
108274,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.312,CAMILLO,"Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,"
108275,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.313,CAMILLO,"Be plainer with me, let me know my trespass"
108276,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.314,CAMILLO,"By its own visage: if I then deny it,"
108277,A Winters Tale,68.0,1.2.315,CAMILLO,'Tis none of mine.
108278,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.316,LEONTES,"Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--"
108279,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.317,LEONTES,"But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass"
108280,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.318,LEONTES,"Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--"
108281,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.319,LEONTES,For to a vision so apparent rumour
108282,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.320,LEONTES,"Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation"
108283,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.321,LEONTES,"Resides not in that man that does not think,--"
108284,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.322,LEONTES,"My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,"
108285,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.323,LEONTES,"Or else be impudently negative,"
108286,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.324,LEONTES,"To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say"
108287,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.325,LEONTES,"My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name"
108288,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.326,LEONTES,As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
108289,A Winters Tale,69.0,1.2.327,LEONTES,Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
108290,A Winters Tale,70.0,1.2.328,CAMILLO,I would not be a stander-by to hear
108291,A Winters Tale,70.0,1.2.329,CAMILLO,"My sovereign mistress clouded so, without"
108292,A Winters Tale,70.0,1.2.330,CAMILLO,"My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,"
108293,A Winters Tale,70.0,1.2.331,CAMILLO,You never spoke what did become you less
108294,A Winters Tale,70.0,1.2.332,CAMILLO,"Than this, which to reiterate were sin"
108295,A Winters Tale,70.0,1.2.333,CAMILLO,"As deep as that, though true."
108296,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.334,LEONTES,Is whispering nothing?
108297,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.335,LEONTES,Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
108298,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.336,LEONTES,Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
108299,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.337,LEONTES,Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
108300,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.338,LEONTES,Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
108301,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.339,LEONTES,Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
108302,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.340,LEONTES,"Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes"
108303,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.341,LEONTES,"Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,"
108304,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.342,LEONTES,That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
108305,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.343,LEONTES,"Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing,"
108306,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.344,LEONTES,"The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,"
108307,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.345,LEONTES,"My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,"
108308,A Winters Tale,71.0,1.2.346,LEONTES,If this be nothing.
108309,A Winters Tale,72.0,1.2.347,CAMILLO,"Good my lord, be cured"
108310,A Winters Tale,72.0,1.2.348,CAMILLO,"Of this diseased opinion, and betimes,"
108311,A Winters Tale,72.0,1.2.349,CAMILLO,For 'tis most dangerous.
108312,A Winters Tale,73.0,1.2.350,LEONTES,"Say it be, 'tis true."
108313,A Winters Tale,74.0,1.2.351,CAMILLO,"No, no, my lord."
108314,A Winters Tale,75.0,1.2.352,LEONTES,"It is, you lie, you lie:"
108315,A Winters Tale,75.0,1.2.353,LEONTES,"I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,"
108316,A Winters Tale,75.0,1.2.354,LEONTES,"Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,"
108317,A Winters Tale,75.0,1.2.355,LEONTES,"Or else a hovering temporizer, that"
108318,A Winters Tale,75.0,1.2.356,LEONTES,"Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,"
108319,A Winters Tale,75.0,1.2.357,LEONTES,Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
108320,A Winters Tale,75.0,1.2.358,LEONTES,"Infected as her life, she would not live"
108321,A Winters Tale,75.0,1.2.359,LEONTES,The running of one glass.
108322,A Winters Tale,76.0,1.2.360,CAMILLO,Who does infect her?
108323,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.361,LEONTES,"Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging"
108324,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.362,LEONTES,"About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I"
108325,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.363,LEONTES,"Had servants true about me, that bare eyes"
108326,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.364,LEONTES,"To see alike mine honour as their profits,"
108327,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.365,LEONTES,"Their own particular thrifts, they would do that"
108328,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.366,LEONTES,"Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,"
108329,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.367,LEONTES,"His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form"
108330,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.368,LEONTES,"Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see"
108331,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.369,LEONTES,"Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,"
108332,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.370,LEONTES,"How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,"
108333,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.371,LEONTES,"To give mine enemy a lasting wink,"
108334,A Winters Tale,77.0,1.2.372,LEONTES,Which draught to me were cordial.
108335,A Winters Tale,78.0,1.2.373,CAMILLO,"Sir, my lord,"
108336,A Winters Tale,78.0,1.2.374,CAMILLO,"I could do this, and that with no rash potion,"
108337,A Winters Tale,78.0,1.2.375,CAMILLO,But with a lingering dram that should not work
108338,A Winters Tale,78.0,1.2.376,CAMILLO,Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
108339,A Winters Tale,78.0,1.2.377,CAMILLO,"Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,"
108340,A Winters Tale,78.0,1.2.378,CAMILLO,So sovereignly being honourable.
108341,A Winters Tale,78.0,1.2.379,CAMILLO,"I have loved thee,--"
108342,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.380,LEONTES,"Make that thy question, and go rot!"
108343,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.381,LEONTES,"Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,"
108344,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.382,LEONTES,"To appoint myself in this vexation, sully"
108345,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.383,LEONTES,"The purity and whiteness of my sheets,"
108346,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.384,LEONTES,"Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted"
108347,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.385,LEONTES,"Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,"
108348,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.386,LEONTES,"Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,"
108349,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.387,LEONTES,"Who I do think is mine and love as mine,"
108350,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.388,LEONTES,Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
108351,A Winters Tale,79.0,1.2.389,LEONTES,Could man so blench?
108352,A Winters Tale,80.0,1.2.390,CAMILLO,"I must believe you, sir:"
108353,A Winters Tale,80.0,1.2.391,CAMILLO,"I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for't,"
108354,A Winters Tale,80.0,1.2.392,CAMILLO,"Provided that, when he's removed, your highness"
108355,A Winters Tale,80.0,1.2.393,CAMILLO,"Will take again your queen as yours at first,"
108356,A Winters Tale,80.0,1.2.394,CAMILLO,"Even for your son's sake, and thereby for sealing"
108357,A Winters Tale,80.0,1.2.395,CAMILLO,The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
108358,A Winters Tale,80.0,1.2.396,CAMILLO,Known and allied to yours.
108359,A Winters Tale,81.0,1.2.397,LEONTES,Thou dost advise me
108360,A Winters Tale,81.0,1.2.398,LEONTES,Even so as I mine own course have set down:
108361,A Winters Tale,81.0,1.2.399,LEONTES,"I'll give no blemish to her honour, none."
108362,A Winters Tale,82.0,1.2.400,CAMILLO,"My lord,"
108363,A Winters Tale,82.0,1.2.401,CAMILLO,"Go then, and with a countenance as clear"
108364,A Winters Tale,82.0,1.2.402,CAMILLO,"As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia"
108365,A Winters Tale,82.0,1.2.403,CAMILLO,And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
108366,A Winters Tale,82.0,1.2.404,CAMILLO,"If from me he have wholesome beverage,"
108367,A Winters Tale,82.0,1.2.405,CAMILLO,Account me not your servant.
108368,A Winters Tale,83.0,1.2.406,LEONTES,This is all:
108369,A Winters Tale,83.0,1.2.407,LEONTES,"Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart,"
108370,A Winters Tale,83.0,1.2.408,LEONTES,"Do't not, thou split'st thine own."
108371,A Winters Tale,84.0,1.2.409,CAMILLO,"I'll do't, my lord."
108372,A Winters Tale,85.0,1.2.410,LEONTES,"I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me."
108373,A Winters Tale,85.0,,LEONTES,Exit
108374,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.411,CAMILLO,"O miserable lady! But, for me,"
108375,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.412,CAMILLO,What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
108376,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.413,CAMILLO,"Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do't"
108377,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.414,CAMILLO,"Is the obedience to a master, one"
108378,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.415,CAMILLO,Who in rebellion with himself will have
108379,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.416,CAMILLO,"All that are his so too. To do this deed,"
108380,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.417,CAMILLO,Promotion follows. If I could find example
108381,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.418,CAMILLO,Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
108382,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.419,CAMILLO,"And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't, but since"
108383,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.420,CAMILLO,"Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,"
108384,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.421,CAMILLO,Let villany itself forswear't. I must
108385,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.422,CAMILLO,"Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain"
108386,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.423,CAMILLO,"To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!"
108387,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.424,CAMILLO,Here comes Bohemia.
108388,A Winters Tale,86.0,,CAMILLO,Re-enter POLIXENES
108389,A Winters Tale,87.0,1.2.425,POLIXENES,This is strange: methinks
108390,A Winters Tale,87.0,1.2.426,POLIXENES,My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
108391,A Winters Tale,87.0,1.2.427,POLIXENES,"Good day, Camillo."
108392,A Winters Tale,88.0,1.2.428,CAMILLO,"Hail, most royal sir!"
108393,A Winters Tale,89.0,1.2.429,POLIXENES,What is the news i' the court?
108394,A Winters Tale,90.0,1.2.430,CAMILLO,"None rare, my lord."
108395,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.431,POLIXENES,The king hath on him such a countenance
108396,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.432,POLIXENES,As he had lost some province and a region
108397,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.433,POLIXENES,Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
108398,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.434,POLIXENES,"With customary compliment, when he,"
108399,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.435,POLIXENES,Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
108400,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.436,POLIXENES,"A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and"
108401,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.437,POLIXENES,So leaves me to consider what is breeding
108402,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.438,POLIXENES,That changeth thus his manners.
108403,A Winters Tale,92.0,1.2.439,CAMILLO,"I dare not know, my lord."
108404,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.440,POLIXENES,"How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?"
108405,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.441,POLIXENES,"Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts,"
108406,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.442,POLIXENES,"For, to yourself, what you do know, you must."
108407,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.443,POLIXENES,"And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,"
108408,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.444,POLIXENES,Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
108409,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.445,POLIXENES,"Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be"
108410,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.446,POLIXENES,"A party in this alteration, finding"
108411,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.447,POLIXENES,Myself thus alter'd with 't.
108412,A Winters Tale,94.0,1.2.448,CAMILLO,There is a sickness
108413,A Winters Tale,94.0,1.2.449,CAMILLO,"Which puts some of us in distemper, but"
108414,A Winters Tale,94.0,1.2.450,CAMILLO,"I cannot name the disease, and it is caught"
108415,A Winters Tale,94.0,1.2.451,CAMILLO,Of you that yet are well.
108416,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.452,POLIXENES,How! caught of me!
108417,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.453,POLIXENES,Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
108418,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.454,POLIXENES,"I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better"
108419,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.455,POLIXENES,"By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--"
108420,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.456,POLIXENES,"As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto"
108421,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.457,POLIXENES,"Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns"
108422,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.458,POLIXENES,"Our gentry than our parents' noble names,"
108423,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.459,POLIXENES,"In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,"
108424,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.460,POLIXENES,If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
108425,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.461,POLIXENES,"Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not"
108426,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.462,POLIXENES,In ignorant concealment.
108427,A Winters Tale,96.0,1.2.463,CAMILLO,I may not answer.
108428,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.464,POLIXENES,"A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!"
108429,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.465,POLIXENES,"I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,"
108430,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.466,POLIXENES,"I conjure thee, by all the parts of man"
108431,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.467,POLIXENES,"Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least"
108432,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.468,POLIXENES,"Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare"
108433,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.469,POLIXENES,What incidency thou dost guess of harm
108434,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.470,POLIXENES,"Is creeping toward me, how far off, how near,"
108435,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.471,POLIXENES,"Which way to be prevented, if to be,"
108436,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.472,POLIXENES,"If not, how best to bear it."
108437,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.473,CAMILLO,"Sir, I will tell you,"
108438,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.474,CAMILLO,Since I am charged in honour and by him
108439,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.475,CAMILLO,"That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,"
108440,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.476,CAMILLO,Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
108441,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.477,CAMILLO,"I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me"
108442,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.478,CAMILLO,"Cry lost, and so good night!"
108443,A Winters Tale,99.0,1.2.479,POLIXENES,"On, good Camillo."
108444,A Winters Tale,100.0,1.2.480,CAMILLO,I am appointed him to murder you.
108445,A Winters Tale,101.0,1.2.481,POLIXENES,"By whom, Camillo?"
108446,A Winters Tale,102.0,1.2.482,CAMILLO,By the king.
108447,A Winters Tale,103.0,1.2.483,POLIXENES,For what?
108448,A Winters Tale,104.0,1.2.484,CAMILLO,"He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,"
108449,A Winters Tale,104.0,1.2.485,CAMILLO,As he had seen't or been an instrument
108450,A Winters Tale,104.0,1.2.486,CAMILLO,"To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen"
108451,A Winters Tale,104.0,1.2.487,CAMILLO,Forbiddenly.
108452,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.488,POLIXENES,"O, then my best blood turn"
108453,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.489,POLIXENES,To an infected jelly and my name
108454,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.490,POLIXENES,Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
108455,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.491,POLIXENES,Turn then my freshest reputation to
108456,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.492,POLIXENES,A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
108457,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.493,POLIXENES,"Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,"
108458,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.494,POLIXENES,"Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection"
108459,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.495,POLIXENES,That e'er was heard or read!
108460,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.496,CAMILLO,Swear his thought over
108461,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.497,CAMILLO,By each particular star in heaven and
108462,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.498,CAMILLO,"By all their influences, you may as well"
108463,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.499,CAMILLO,Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
108464,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.500,CAMILLO,As or by oath remove or counsel shake
108465,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.501,CAMILLO,"The fabric of his folly, whose foundation"
108466,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.502,CAMILLO,Is piled upon his faith and will continue
108467,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.503,CAMILLO,The standing of his body.
108468,A Winters Tale,107.0,1.2.504,POLIXENES,How should this grow?
108469,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.505,CAMILLO,I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
108470,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.506,CAMILLO,Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
108471,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.507,CAMILLO,"If therefore you dare trust my honesty,"
108472,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.508,CAMILLO,That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
108473,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.509,CAMILLO,"Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!"
108474,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.510,CAMILLO,"Your followers I will whisper to the business,"
108475,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.511,CAMILLO,And will by twos and threes at several posterns
108476,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.512,CAMILLO,"Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put"
108477,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.513,CAMILLO,"My fortunes to your service, which are here"
108478,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.514,CAMILLO,"By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,"
108479,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.515,CAMILLO,"For, by the honour of my parents, I"
108480,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.516,CAMILLO,"Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,"
108481,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.517,CAMILLO,"I dare not stand by, nor shall you be safer"
108482,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.518,CAMILLO,"Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon"
108483,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.519,CAMILLO,His execution sworn.
108484,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.520,POLIXENES,I do believe thee:
108485,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.521,POLIXENES,I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
108486,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.522,POLIXENES,Be pilot to me and thy places shall
108487,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.523,POLIXENES,Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
108488,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.524,POLIXENES,My people did expect my hence departure
108489,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.525,POLIXENES,Two days ago. This jealousy
108490,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.526,POLIXENES,"Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,"
108491,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.527,POLIXENES,"Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,"
108492,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.528,POLIXENES,"Must it be violent, and as he does conceive"
108493,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.529,POLIXENES,He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
108494,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.530,POLIXENES,"Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must"
108495,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.531,POLIXENES,In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
108496,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.532,POLIXENES,"Good expedition be my friend, and comfort"
108497,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.533,POLIXENES,"The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing"
108498,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.534,POLIXENES,"Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo,"
108499,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.535,POLIXENES,I will respect thee as a father if
108500,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.536,POLIXENES,Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
108501,A Winters Tale,110.0,1.2.537,CAMILLO,It is in mine authority to command
108502,A Winters Tale,110.0,1.2.538,CAMILLO,The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
108503,A Winters Tale,110.0,1.2.539,CAMILLO,"To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away."
108504,A Winters Tale,110.0,,CAMILLO,Exeunt
108505,A Winters Tale,110.0,,CAMILLO,ACT II
108506,A Winters Tale,110.0,,CAMILLO,SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
108507,A Winters Tale,110.0,,CAMILLO,"Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies"
108508,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.1.1,HERMIONE,"Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,"
108509,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.1.2,HERMIONE,'Tis past enduring.
108510,A Winters Tale,2.0,2.1.3,First Lady,"Come, my gracious lord,"
108511,A Winters Tale,2.0,2.1.4,First Lady,Shall I be your playfellow?
108512,A Winters Tale,3.0,2.1.5,MAMILLIUS,"No, I'll none of you."
108513,A Winters Tale,4.0,2.1.6,First Lady,"Why, my sweet lord?"
108514,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.1.7,MAMILLIUS,You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
108515,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.1.8,MAMILLIUS,I were a baby still. I love you better.
108516,A Winters Tale,6.0,2.1.9,Second Lady,"And why so, my lord?"
108517,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.10,MAMILLIUS,Not for because
108518,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.11,MAMILLIUS,"Your brows are blacker, yet black brows, they say,"
108519,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.12,MAMILLIUS,"Become some women best, so that there be not"
108520,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.13,MAMILLIUS,"Too much hair there, but in a semicircle"
108521,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.14,MAMILLIUS,Or a half-moon made with a pen.
108522,A Winters Tale,8.0,2.1.15,Second Lady,Who taught you this?
108523,A Winters Tale,9.0,2.1.16,MAMILLIUS,I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
108524,A Winters Tale,9.0,2.1.17,MAMILLIUS,What colour are your eyebrows?
108525,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.1.18,First Lady,"Blue, my lord."
108526,A Winters Tale,11.0,2.1.19,MAMILLIUS,"Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose"
108527,A Winters Tale,11.0,2.1.20,MAMILLIUS,"That has been blue, but not her eyebrows."
108528,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.21,First Lady,"Hark ye,"
108529,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.22,First Lady,The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
108530,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.23,First Lady,Present our services to a fine new prince
108531,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.24,First Lady,"One of these days, and then you'ld wanton with us,"
108532,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.25,First Lady,If we would have you.
108533,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.1.26,Second Lady,She is spread of late
108534,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.1.27,Second Lady,Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
108535,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.1.28,HERMIONE,"What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now"
108536,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.1.29,HERMIONE,"I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,"
108537,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.1.30,HERMIONE,And tell 's a tale.
108538,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.1.31,MAMILLIUS,Merry or sad shall't be?
108539,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.1.32,HERMIONE,As merry as you will.
108540,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.1.33,MAMILLIUS,A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
108541,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.1.34,MAMILLIUS,Of sprites and goblins.
108542,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.1.35,HERMIONE,"Let's have that, good sir."
108543,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.1.36,HERMIONE,"Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best"
108544,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.1.37,HERMIONE,"To fright me with your sprites, you're powerful at it."
108545,A Winters Tale,19.0,2.1.38,MAMILLIUS,There was a man--
108546,A Winters Tale,20.0,2.1.39,HERMIONE,"Nay, come, sit down, then on."
108547,A Winters Tale,21.0,2.1.40,MAMILLIUS,"Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly,"
108548,A Winters Tale,21.0,2.1.41,MAMILLIUS,Yond crickets shall not hear it.
108549,A Winters Tale,22.0,2.1.42,HERMIONE,"Come on, then,"
108550,A Winters Tale,22.0,2.1.43,HERMIONE,And give't me in mine ear.
108551,A Winters Tale,22.0,,HERMIONE,"Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others"
108552,A Winters Tale,23.0,2.1.44,LEONTES,Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
108553,A Winters Tale,24.0,2.1.45,First Lord,"Behind the tuft of pines I met them, never"
108554,A Winters Tale,24.0,2.1.46,First Lord,Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
108555,A Winters Tale,24.0,2.1.47,First Lord,Even to their ships.
108556,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.48,LEONTES,How blest am I
108557,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.49,LEONTES,"In my just censure, in my true opinion!"
108558,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.50,LEONTES,"Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed"
108559,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.51,LEONTES,In being so blest! There may be in the cup
108560,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.52,LEONTES,"A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,"
108561,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.53,LEONTES,"And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge"
108562,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.54,LEONTES,Is not infected: but if one present
108563,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.55,LEONTES,"The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known"
108564,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.56,LEONTES,"How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,"
108565,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.57,LEONTES,"With violent hefts. I have drunk,"
108566,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.58,LEONTES,and seen the spider.
108567,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.59,LEONTES,"Camillo was his help in this, his pander:"
108568,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.60,LEONTES,"There is a plot against my life, my crown,"
108569,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.61,LEONTES,All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
108570,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.62,LEONTES,Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
108571,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.63,LEONTES,"He has discover'd my design, and I"
108572,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.64,LEONTES,"Remain a pinch'd thing, yea, a very trick"
108573,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.65,LEONTES,For them to play at will. How came the posterns
108574,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.66,LEONTES,So easily open?
108575,A Winters Tale,26.0,2.1.67,First Lord,"By his great authority,"
108576,A Winters Tale,26.0,2.1.68,First Lord,Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
108577,A Winters Tale,26.0,2.1.69,First Lord,On your command.
108578,A Winters Tale,27.0,2.1.70,LEONTES,I know't too well.
108579,A Winters Tale,27.0,2.1.71,LEONTES,Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
108580,A Winters Tale,27.0,2.1.72,LEONTES,"Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you"
108581,A Winters Tale,27.0,2.1.73,LEONTES,Have too much blood in him.
108582,A Winters Tale,28.0,2.1.74,HERMIONE,What is this? sport?
108583,A Winters Tale,29.0,2.1.75,LEONTES,"Bear the boy hence, he shall not come about her,"
108584,A Winters Tale,29.0,2.1.76,LEONTES,Away with him! and let her sport herself
108585,A Winters Tale,29.0,2.1.77,LEONTES,"With that she's big with, for 'tis Polixenes"
108586,A Winters Tale,29.0,2.1.78,LEONTES,Has made thee swell thus.
108587,A Winters Tale,30.0,2.1.79,HERMIONE,"But I'ld say he had not,"
108588,A Winters Tale,30.0,2.1.80,HERMIONE,"And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,"
108589,A Winters Tale,30.0,2.1.81,HERMIONE,Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
108590,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.82,LEONTES,"You, my lords,"
108591,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.83,LEONTES,"Look on her, mark her well, be but about"
108592,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.84,LEONTES,"To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and"
108593,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.85,LEONTES,The justice of your bearts will thereto add
108594,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.86,LEONTES,"'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'"
108595,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.87,LEONTES,"Praise her but for this her without-door form,"
108596,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.88,LEONTES,"Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight"
108597,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.89,LEONTES,"The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands"
108598,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.90,LEONTES,"That calumny doth use--O, I am out--"
108599,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.91,LEONTES,"That mercy does, for calumny will sear"
108600,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.92,LEONTES,"Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,"
108601,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.93,LEONTES,"When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between"
108602,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.94,LEONTES,"Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,"
108603,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.95,LEONTES,"From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,"
108604,A Winters Tale,31.0,2.1.96,LEONTES,She's an adulteress.
108605,A Winters Tale,32.0,2.1.97,HERMIONE,"Should a villain say so,"
108606,A Winters Tale,32.0,2.1.98,HERMIONE,"The most replenish'd villain in the world,"
108607,A Winters Tale,32.0,2.1.99,HERMIONE,"He were as much more villain: you, my lord,"
108608,A Winters Tale,32.0,2.1.100,HERMIONE,Do but mistake.
108609,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.101,LEONTES,"You have mistook, my lady,"
108610,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.102,LEONTES,Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
108611,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.103,LEONTES,"Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,"
108612,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.104,LEONTES,"Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,"
108613,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.105,LEONTES,Should a like language use to all degrees
108614,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.106,LEONTES,And mannerly distinguishment leave out
108615,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.107,LEONTES,Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
108616,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.108,LEONTES,"She's an adulteress, I have said with whom:"
108617,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.109,LEONTES,"More, she's a traitor and Camillo is"
108618,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.110,LEONTES,"A federary with her, and one that knows"
108619,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.111,LEONTES,What she should shame to know herself
108620,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.112,LEONTES,"But with her most vile principal, that she's"
108621,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.113,LEONTES,"A bed-swerver, even as bad as those"
108622,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.114,LEONTES,"That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy"
108623,A Winters Tale,33.0,2.1.115,LEONTES,To this their late escape.
108624,A Winters Tale,34.0,2.1.116,HERMIONE,"No, by my life."
108625,A Winters Tale,34.0,2.1.117,HERMIONE,"Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,"
108626,A Winters Tale,34.0,2.1.118,HERMIONE,"When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that"
108627,A Winters Tale,34.0,2.1.119,HERMIONE,"You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,"
108628,A Winters Tale,34.0,2.1.120,HERMIONE,You scarce can right me throughly then to say
108629,A Winters Tale,34.0,2.1.121,HERMIONE,You did mistake.
108630,A Winters Tale,35.0,2.1.122,LEONTES,"No, if I mistake"
108631,A Winters Tale,35.0,2.1.123,LEONTES,"In those foundations which I build upon,"
108632,A Winters Tale,35.0,2.1.124,LEONTES,The centre is not big enough to bear
108633,A Winters Tale,35.0,2.1.125,LEONTES,A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
108634,A Winters Tale,35.0,2.1.126,LEONTES,He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
108635,A Winters Tale,35.0,2.1.127,LEONTES,But that he speaks.
108636,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.128,HERMIONE,There's some ill planet reigns:
108637,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.129,HERMIONE,I must be patient till the heavens look
108638,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.130,HERMIONE,"With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,"
108639,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.131,HERMIONE,"I am not prone to weeping, as our sex"
108640,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.132,HERMIONE,"Commonly are, the want of which vain dew"
108641,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.133,HERMIONE,Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
108642,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.134,HERMIONE,That honourable grief lodged here which burns
108643,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.135,HERMIONE,"Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,"
108644,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.136,HERMIONE,With thoughts so qualified as your charities
108645,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.137,HERMIONE,"Shall best instruct you, measure me, and so"
108646,A Winters Tale,36.0,2.1.138,HERMIONE,The king's will be perform'd!
108647,A Winters Tale,37.0,2.1.139,LEONTES,Shall I be heard?
108648,A Winters Tale,38.0,2.1.140,HERMIONE,"Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,"
108649,A Winters Tale,38.0,2.1.141,HERMIONE,"My women may be with me, for you see"
108650,A Winters Tale,38.0,2.1.142,HERMIONE,"My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools,"
108651,A Winters Tale,38.0,2.1.143,HERMIONE,There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
108652,A Winters Tale,38.0,2.1.144,HERMIONE,"Has deserved prison, then abound in tears"
108653,A Winters Tale,38.0,2.1.145,HERMIONE,As I come out: this action I now go on
108654,A Winters Tale,38.0,2.1.146,HERMIONE,"Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:"
108655,A Winters Tale,38.0,2.1.147,HERMIONE,"I never wish'd to see you sorry, now"
108656,A Winters Tale,38.0,2.1.148,HERMIONE,"I trust I shall. My women, come, you have leave."
108657,A Winters Tale,39.0,2.1.149,LEONTES,"Go, do our bidding, hence!"
108658,A Winters Tale,39.0,2.1.149,LEONTES,"Exit HERMIONE, guarded, with Ladies"
108659,A Winters Tale,40.0,2.1.150,First Lord,"Beseech your highness, call the queen again."
108660,A Winters Tale,41.0,2.1.151,ANTIGONUS,"Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice"
108661,A Winters Tale,41.0,2.1.152,ANTIGONUS,"Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer,"
108662,A Winters Tale,41.0,2.1.153,ANTIGONUS,"Yourself, your queen, your son."
108663,A Winters Tale,42.0,2.1.154,First Lord,"For her, my lord,"
108664,A Winters Tale,42.0,2.1.155,First Lord,"I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,"
108665,A Winters Tale,42.0,2.1.156,First Lord,"Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless"
108666,A Winters Tale,42.0,2.1.157,First Lord,"I' the eyes of heaven and to you, I mean,"
108667,A Winters Tale,42.0,2.1.158,First Lord,In this which you accuse her.
108668,A Winters Tale,43.0,2.1.159,ANTIGONUS,If it prove
108669,A Winters Tale,43.0,2.1.160,ANTIGONUS,"She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where"
108670,A Winters Tale,43.0,2.1.161,ANTIGONUS,"I lodge my wife, I'll go in couples with her,"
108671,A Winters Tale,43.0,2.1.162,ANTIGONUS,"Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her,"
108672,A Winters Tale,43.0,2.1.163,ANTIGONUS,"For every inch of woman in the world,"
108673,A Winters Tale,43.0,2.1.164,ANTIGONUS,"Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be."
108674,A Winters Tale,44.0,2.1.165,LEONTES,Hold your peaces.
108675,A Winters Tale,45.0,2.1.166,First Lord,"Good my lord,--"
108676,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.167,ANTIGONUS,"It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:"
108677,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.168,ANTIGONUS,You are abused and by some putter-on
108678,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.169,ANTIGONUS,"That will be damn'd for't, would I knew the villain,"
108679,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.170,ANTIGONUS,"I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,"
108680,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.171,ANTIGONUS,"I have three daughters, the eldest is eleven"
108681,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.172,ANTIGONUS,"The second and the third, nine, and some five,"
108682,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.173,ANTIGONUS,"If this prove true, they'll pay for't:"
108683,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.174,ANTIGONUS,"by mine honour,"
108684,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.175,ANTIGONUS,"I'll geld 'em all, fourteen they shall not see,"
108685,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.176,ANTIGONUS,"To bring false generations: they are co-heirs,"
108686,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.177,ANTIGONUS,And I had rather glib myself than they
108687,A Winters Tale,46.0,2.1.178,ANTIGONUS,Should not produce fair issue.
108688,A Winters Tale,47.0,2.1.179,LEONTES,"Cease, no more."
108689,A Winters Tale,47.0,2.1.180,LEONTES,You smell this business with a sense as cold
108690,A Winters Tale,47.0,2.1.181,LEONTES,As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't

108694,A Winters Tale,48.0,2.1.185,ANTIGONUS,We need no grave to bury honesty:
108695,A Winters Tale,48.0,2.1.186,ANTIGONUS,There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
108696,A Winters Tale,48.0,2.1.187,ANTIGONUS,Of the whole dungy earth.

108698,A Winters Tale,50.0,2.1.189,First Lord,"I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,"
108699,A Winters Tale,50.0,2.1.190,First Lord,"Upon this ground, and more it would content me"
108700,A Winters Tale,50.0,2.1.191,First Lord,"To have her honour true than your suspicion,"
108701,A Winters Tale,50.0,2.1.192,First Lord,Be blamed for't how you might.
108702,A Winters Tale,51.0,2.1.193,LEONTES,"Why, what need we"
108703,A Winters Tale,51.0,2.1.194,LEONTES,"Commune with you of this, but rather follow"
108704,A Winters Tale,51.0,2.1.195,LEONTES,Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
108705,A Winters Tale,51.0,2.1.196,LEONTES,"Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness"
108706,A Winters Tale,51.0,2.1.197,LEONTES,"Imparts this, which if you, or stupefied"
108707,A Winters Tale,51.0,2.1.198,LEONTES,"Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not"

108710,A Winters Tale,51.0,2.1.201,LEONTES,"The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all"
108711,A Winters Tale,51.0,2.1.202,LEONTES,Properly ours.
108712,A Winters Tale,52.0,2.1.203,ANTIGONUS,"And I wish, my liege,"
108713,A Winters Tale,52.0,2.1.204,ANTIGONUS,"You had only in your silent judgment tried it,"
108714,A Winters Tale,52.0,2.1.205,ANTIGONUS,Without more overture.
108715,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.206,LEONTES,How could that be?
108716,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.207,LEONTES,"Either thou art most ignorant by age,"
108717,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.208,LEONTES,"Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,"
108718,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.209,LEONTES,"Added to their familiarity,"
108719,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.210,LEONTES,"Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,"
108720,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.211,LEONTES,"That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation"
108721,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.212,LEONTES,"But only seeing, all other circumstances"
108722,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.213,LEONTES,"Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:"
108723,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.214,LEONTES,"Yet, for a greater confirmation,"
108724,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.215,LEONTES,For in an act of this importance 'twere

108726,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.217,LEONTES,"To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,"
108727,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.218,LEONTES,"Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know"
108728,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.219,LEONTES,Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
108729,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.220,LEONTES,"They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,"
108730,A Winters Tale,53.0,2.1.221,LEONTES,Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
108731,A Winters Tale,54.0,2.1.222,First Lord,"Well done, my lord."
108732,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.223,LEONTES,Though I am satisfied and need no more
108733,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.224,LEONTES,"Than what I know, yet shall the oracle"
108734,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.225,LEONTES,"Give rest to the minds of others, such as he"
108735,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.226,LEONTES,Whose ignorant credulity will not
108736,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.227,LEONTES,Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
108737,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.228,LEONTES,"From our free person she should be confined,"
108738,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.229,LEONTES,Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
108739,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.230,LEONTES,"Be left her to perform. Come, follow us,"
108740,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.231,LEONTES,"We are to speak in public, for this business"
108741,A Winters Tale,55.0,2.1.232,LEONTES,Will raise us all.

108753,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.2.5,PAULINA,What dost thou then in prison?
108754,A Winters Tale,1.0,,PAULINA,"Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler"

108804,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.2.52,PAULINA,How he may soften at the sight o' the child:

108815,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.2.63,EMILIA,"But durst not tempt a minister of honour,"
108816,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.2.64,EMILIA,Lest she should be denied.
108817,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.2.65,PAULINA,"Tell her, Emilia."
108818,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.2.66,PAULINA,I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
108819,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.2.67,PAULINA,"As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted"
108820,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.2.68,PAULINA,I shall do good.
108821,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.2.69,EMILIA,Now be you blest for it!

108826,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.2.74,Gaoler,Having no warrant.
108827,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.2.75,PAULINA,"You need not fear it, sir:"
108828,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.2.76,PAULINA,This child was prisoner to the womb and is
108829,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.2.77,PAULINA,By law and process of great nature thence
108830,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.2.78,PAULINA,"Freed and enfranchised, not a party to"

108833,A Winters Tale,19.0,2.2.81,Gaoler,I do believe it.
108834,A Winters Tale,20.0,2.2.82,PAULINA,"Do not you fear: upon mine honour,"
108835,A Winters Tale,20.0,2.2.83,PAULINA,I will stand betwixt you and danger.

108839,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.1,LEONTES,Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
108840,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.2,LEONTES,"To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If"
108841,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.3,LEONTES,"The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,"
108842,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.4,LEONTES,"She the adulteress, for the harlot king"
108843,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.5,LEONTES,"Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank"
108844,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.6,LEONTES,"And level of my brain, plot-proof, but she"
108845,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.7,LEONTES,"I can hook to me: say that she were gone,"
108846,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.8,LEONTES,"Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest"
108847,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.9,LEONTES,Might come to me again. Who's there?
108848,A Winters Tale,2.0,2.3.10,First Servant,My lord?
108849,A Winters Tale,3.0,2.3.11,LEONTES,How does the boy?
108850,A Winters Tale,4.0,2.3.12,First Servant,"He took good rest to-night,"
108851,A Winters Tale,4.0,2.3.13,First Servant,'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
108852,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.14,LEONTES,To see his nobleness!

108854,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.16,LEONTES,"He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,"
108855,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.17,LEONTES,"Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,"
108856,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.18,LEONTES,"Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,"
108857,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.19,LEONTES,"And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,"
108858,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.20,LEONTES,See how he fares.
108859,A Winters Tale,5.0,,LEONTES,Exit Servant

108868,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.29,LEONTES,Shall she within my power.

108870,A Winters Tale,6.0,2.3.30,First Lord,You must not enter.
108871,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.3.31,PAULINA,"Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:"
108872,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.3.32,PAULINA,"Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,"
108873,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.3.33,PAULINA,"Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,"
108874,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.3.34,PAULINA,More free than he is jealous.
108875,A Winters Tale,8.0,2.3.35,ANTIGONUS,That's enough.

108877,A Winters Tale,9.0,2.3.37,Second Servant,None should come at him.
108878,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.38,PAULINA,"Not so hot, good sir:"
108879,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.39,PAULINA,"I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,"
108880,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.40,PAULINA,That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
108881,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.41,PAULINA,"At each his needless heavings, such as you"
108882,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.42,PAULINA,Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
108883,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.43,PAULINA,"Do come with words as medicinal as true,"
108884,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.44,PAULINA,"Honest as either, to purge him of that humour"
108885,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.45,PAULINA,That presses him from sleep.
108886,A Winters Tale,11.0,2.3.46,LEONTES,"What noise there, ho?"
108887,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.3.47,PAULINA,"No noise, my lord, but needful conference"
108888,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.3.48,PAULINA,About some gossips for your highness.
108889,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.3.49,LEONTES,How!
108890,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.3.50,LEONTES,"Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,"
108891,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.3.51,LEONTES,I charged thee that she should not come about me:
108892,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.3.52,LEONTES,I knew she would.
108893,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.3.53,ANTIGONUS,"I told her so, my lord,"
108894,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.3.54,ANTIGONUS,"On your displeasure's peril and on mine,"
108895,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.3.55,ANTIGONUS,She should not visit you.
108896,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.3.56,LEONTES,"What, canst not rule her?"
108897,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.3.57,PAULINA,"From all dishonesty he can: in this,"
108898,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.3.58,PAULINA,"Unless he take the course that you have done,"
108899,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.3.59,PAULINA,"Commit me for committing honour, trust it,"
108900,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.3.60,PAULINA,He shall not rule me.
108901,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.3.61,ANTIGONUS,"La you now, you hear:"
108902,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.3.62,ANTIGONUS,"When she will take the rein I let her run,"
108903,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.3.63,ANTIGONUS,But she'll not stumble.
108904,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.3.64,PAULINA,"Good my liege, I come,"
108905,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.3.65,PAULINA,"And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess"
108906,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.3.66,PAULINA,"Myself your loyal servant, your physician,"

109172,A Winters Tale,5.0,3.2.45,HERMIONE,And only that I stand for. I appeal

109185,A Winters Tale,6.0,3.2.58,LEONTES,Than to perform it first.
109186,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.2.59,HERMIONE,"That's true enough,"
109187,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.2.60,HERMIONE,"Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me."

109200,A Winters Tale,9.0,3.2.73,HERMIONE,"Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely"
109201,A Winters Tale,9.0,3.2.74,HERMIONE,"That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,"
109202,A Winters Tale,9.0,3.2.75,HERMIONE,"I know not how it tastes, though it be dish'd"
109203,A Winters Tale,9.0,3.2.76,HERMIONE,For me to try how: all I know of it

109212,A Winters Tale,11.0,3.2.85,HERMIONE,Which I'll lay down.

109214,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.87,LEONTES,"You had a bastard by Polixenes,"
109215,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.88,LEONTES,"And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--"
109216,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.89,LEONTES,Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
109217,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.90,LEONTES,"Which to deny concerns more than avails, for as"
109218,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.91,LEONTES,"Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,"

109222,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.95,LEONTES,Look for no less than death.
109223,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.96,HERMIONE,"Sir, spare your threats:"
109224,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.97,HERMIONE,The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
109225,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.98,HERMIONE,To me can life be no commodity:

109227,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.100,HERMIONE,"I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,"
109228,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.101,HERMIONE,But know not how it went. My second joy
109229,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.102,HERMIONE,"And first-fruits of my body, from his presence"
109230,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.103,HERMIONE,"I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort"
109231,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.104,HERMIONE,"Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,"
109232,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.105,HERMIONE,"The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,"
109233,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.106,HERMIONE,Haled out to murder: myself on every post

109324,A Winters Tale,35.0,3.2.191,First Lord,"What fit is this, good lady?"
109325,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.192,PAULINA,"What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?"
109326,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.193,PAULINA,What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
109327,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.194,PAULINA,In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
109328,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.195,PAULINA,"Must I receive, whose every word deserves"
109329,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.196,PAULINA,To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny

109334,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.201,PAULINA,Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
109335,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.202,PAULINA,"That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing,"
109336,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.203,PAULINA,"That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant"

109339,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.206,PAULINA,"To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,"
109340,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.207,PAULINA,More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
109341,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.208,PAULINA,The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
109342,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.209,PAULINA,"To be or none or little, though a devil"
109343,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.210,PAULINA,Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:

109361,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.228,PAULINA,"Than all thy woes can stir, therefore betake thee"
109362,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.229,PAULINA,To nothing but despair. A thousand knees

109369,A Winters Tale,39.0,3.2.236,LEONTES,All tongues to talk their bitterest.
109370,A Winters Tale,40.0,3.2.237,First Lord,Say no more:
109371,A Winters Tale,40.0,3.2.238,First Lord,"Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault"
109372,A Winters Tale,40.0,3.2.239,First Lord,I' the boldness of your speech.
109373,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.240,PAULINA,I am sorry for't:
109374,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.241,PAULINA,"All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,"
109375,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.242,PAULINA,I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
109376,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.243,PAULINA,The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
109377,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.244,PAULINA,To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
109378,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.245,PAULINA,Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
109379,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.246,PAULINA,"At my petition, I beseech you, rather"
109380,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.247,PAULINA,"Let me be punish'd, that have minded you"
109381,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.248,PAULINA,"Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege"
109382,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.249,PAULINA,"Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:"
109383,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.250,PAULINA,"The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--"
109384,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.251,PAULINA,"I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children,"
109385,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.252,PAULINA,"I'll not remember you of my own lord,"
109386,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.253,PAULINA,"Who is lost too: take your patience to you,"
109387,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.254,PAULINA,And I'll say nothing.
109388,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.255,LEONTES,Thou didst speak but well
109389,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.256,LEONTES,"When most the truth, which I receive much better"
109390,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.257,LEONTES,"Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me"
109391,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.258,LEONTES,To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
109392,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.259,LEONTES,One grave shall be for both: upon them shall

109394,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.261,LEONTES,Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
109395,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.262,LEONTES,"The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there"
109396,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.263,LEONTES,Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
109397,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.264,LEONTES,"Will bear up with this exercise, so long"
109398,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.265,LEONTES,I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
109399,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.266,LEONTES,Unto these sorrows.

109405,A Winters Tale,2.0,3.3.3,Mariner,"Ay, my lord: and fear"
109406,A Winters Tale,2.0,3.3.4,Mariner,We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
109407,A Winters Tale,2.0,3.3.5,Mariner,"And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,"
109408,A Winters Tale,2.0,3.3.6,Mariner,The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
109409,A Winters Tale,2.0,3.3.7,Mariner,And frown upon 's.
109410,A Winters Tale,3.0,3.3.8,ANTIGONUS,"Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard,"
109411,A Winters Tale,3.0,3.3.9,ANTIGONUS,Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
109412,A Winters Tale,3.0,3.3.10,ANTIGONUS,I call upon thee.
109413,A Winters Tale,4.0,3.3.11,Mariner,"Make your best haste, and go not"
109414,A Winters Tale,4.0,3.3.12,Mariner,"Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather,"
109415,A Winters Tale,4.0,3.3.13,Mariner,"Besides, this place is famous for the creatures"
109416,A Winters Tale,4.0,3.3.14,Mariner,Of prey that keep upon't.
109417,A Winters Tale,5.0,3.3.15,ANTIGONUS,Go thou away:
109418,A Winters Tale,5.0,3.3.16,ANTIGONUS,I'll follow instantly.
109419,A Winters Tale,6.0,3.3.17,Mariner,I am glad at heart
109420,A Winters Tale,6.0,3.3.18,Mariner,To be so rid o' the business.
109421,A Winters Tale,6.0,,Mariner,Exit
109422,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.19,ANTIGONUS,"Come, poor babe:"
109423,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.20,ANTIGONUS,"I have heard, but not believed,"
109424,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.21,ANTIGONUS,the spirits o' the dead
109425,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.22,ANTIGONUS,"May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother"
109426,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.23,ANTIGONUS,"Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream"
109427,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.24,ANTIGONUS,"So like a waking. To me comes a creature,"
109428,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.25,ANTIGONUS,"Sometimes her head on one side, some another,"
109429,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.26,ANTIGONUS,"I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,"
109430,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.27,ANTIGONUS,"So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,"
109431,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.28,ANTIGONUS,"Like very sanctity, she did approach"
109432,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.29,ANTIGONUS,"My cabin where I lay, thrice bow'd before me,"
109433,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.30,ANTIGONUS,"And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes"
109434,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.31,ANTIGONUS,"Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon"
109435,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.32,ANTIGONUS,"Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,"
109436,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.33,ANTIGONUS,"Since fate, against thy better disposition,"
109437,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.34,ANTIGONUS,Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
109438,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.35,ANTIGONUS,"Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,"

109442,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.39,ANTIGONUS,"I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business"
109443,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.40,ANTIGONUS,"Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see"
109444,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.41,ANTIGONUS,"Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks"
109445,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.42,ANTIGONUS,"She melted into air. Affrighted much,"
109446,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.43,ANTIGONUS,I did in time collect myself and thought
109447,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.44,ANTIGONUS,This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
109448,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.45,ANTIGONUS,"Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,"
109449,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.46,ANTIGONUS,I will be squared by this. I do believe
109450,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.47,ANTIGONUS,"Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that"
109451,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.48,ANTIGONUS,"Apollo would, this being indeed the issue"
109452,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.49,ANTIGONUS,"Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,"
109453,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.50,ANTIGONUS,"Either for life or death, upon the earth"
109454,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.51,ANTIGONUS,"Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!"
109455,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.52,ANTIGONUS,"There lie, and there thy character: there these,"
109456,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.53,ANTIGONUS,"Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,"
109457,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.54,ANTIGONUS,"And still rest thine. The storm begins, poor wretch,"
109458,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.55,ANTIGONUS,That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
109459,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.56,ANTIGONUS,"To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,"
109460,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.57,ANTIGONUS,"But my heart bleeds, and most accursed am I"
109461,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.58,ANTIGONUS,To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
109462,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.59,ANTIGONUS,The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
109463,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.60,ANTIGONUS,A lullaby too rough: I never saw
109464,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.61,ANTIGONUS,The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
109465,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.62,ANTIGONUS,Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
109466,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.63,ANTIGONUS,I am gone for ever.
109467,A Winters Tale,7.0,,ANTIGONUS,"Exit, pursued by a bear"
109468,A Winters Tale,7.0,,ANTIGONUS,Enter a Shepherd
109469,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.64,Shepherd,I would there were no age between sixteen and
109470,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.65,Shepherd,"three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the"
109471,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.66,Shepherd,"rest, for there is nothing in the between but"
109472,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.67,Shepherd,"getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,"
109473,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.68,Shepherd,"stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but"
109474,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.69,Shepherd,these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
109475,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.70,Shepherd,hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
109476,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.71,Shepherd,"best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find"
109477,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.72,Shepherd,"than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by"
109478,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.73,Shepherd,"the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy"
109479,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.74,Shepherd,"will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very"
109480,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.75,Shepherd,"pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A"
109481,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.76,Shepherd,"pretty one, a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:"
109482,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.77,Shepherd,"though I am not bookish, yet I can read"
109483,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.78,Shepherd,waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
109484,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.79,Shepherd,"some stair-work, some trunk-work, some"
109485,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.80,Shepherd,behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
109486,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.81,Shepherd,than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
109487,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.82,Shepherd,"pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come, he hallooed"
109488,A Winters Tale,8.0,3.3.83,Shepherd,"but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!"
109489,A Winters Tale,8.0,,Shepherd,Enter Clown
109490,A Winters Tale,9.0,3.3.84,Clown,"Hilloa, loa!"
109491,A Winters Tale,10.0,3.3.85,Shepherd,"What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk"
109492,A Winters Tale,10.0,3.3.86,Shepherd,"on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What"
109493,A Winters Tale,10.0,3.3.87,Shepherd,"ailest thou, man?"
109494,A Winters Tale,11.0,3.3.88,Clown,"I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!"
109495,A Winters Tale,11.0,3.3.89,Clown,"but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the"
109496,A Winters Tale,11.0,3.3.90,Clown,sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
109497,A Winters Tale,11.0,3.3.91,Clown,a bodkin's point.
109498,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.3.92,Shepherd,"Why, boy, how is it?"
109499,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.93,Clown,"I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,"
109500,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.94,Clown,how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
109501,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.95,Clown,"point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!"
109502,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.96,Clown,"sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em, now the"
109503,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.97,Clown,"ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon"

109507,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.101,Clown,"shoulder-bone, how he cried to me for help and said"
109508,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.102,Clown,"his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an"
109509,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.103,Clown,"end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned"
109510,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.104,Clown,"it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the"
109511,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.105,Clown,"sea mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared"
109512,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.106,Clown,"and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than"
109513,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.3.107,Clown,the sea or weather.
109514,A Winters Tale,14.0,3.3.108,Shepherd,"Name of mercy, when was this, boy?"
109515,A Winters Tale,15.0,3.3.109,Clown,"Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these"
109516,A Winters Tale,15.0,3.3.110,Clown,"sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor"
109517,A Winters Tale,15.0,3.3.111,Clown,the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
109518,A Winters Tale,15.0,3.3.112,Clown,now.
109519,A Winters Tale,16.0,3.3.113,Shepherd,"Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!"
109520,A Winters Tale,17.0,3.3.114,Clown,"I would you had been by the ship side, to have"
109521,A Winters Tale,17.0,3.3.115,Clown,helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
109522,A Winters Tale,18.0,3.3.116,Shepherd,"Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,"
109523,A Winters Tale,18.0,3.3.117,Shepherd,boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
109524,A Winters Tale,18.0,3.3.118,Shepherd,"dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for"

109833,A Winters Tale,7.0,4.4.57,FLORIZEL,Of celebration of that nuptial which

109886,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.108,POLIXENES,"Which you say adds to nature, is an art"
109887,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.109,POLIXENES,"That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry"

109920,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.142,PERDITA,But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
109921,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.143,PERDITA,"Or Cytherea's breath, pale primroses"
109922,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.144,PERDITA,"That die unmarried, ere they can behold"
109923,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.145,PERDITA,Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady

110140,A Winters Tale,93.0,4.4.353,Servant,"Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches"
110141,A Winters Tale,93.0,4.4.354,Servant,"say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are"
110142,A Winters Tale,93.0,4.4.355,Servant,"not in't, but they themselves are o' the mind, if it"
110143,A Winters Tale,93.0,4.4.356,Servant,be not too rough for some that know little but
110144,A Winters Tale,93.0,4.4.357,Servant,"bowling, it will please plentifully."
110145,A Winters Tale,94.0,4.4.358,Shepherd,Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
110146,A Winters Tale,94.0,4.4.359,Shepherd,"homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you."
110147,A Winters Tale,95.0,4.4.360,POLIXENES,"You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see"
110148,A Winters Tale,95.0,4.4.361,POLIXENES,these four threes of herdsmen.
110149,A Winters Tale,96.0,4.4.362,Servant,"One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath"
110150,A Winters Tale,96.0,4.4.363,Servant,"danced before the king, and not the worst of the"
110151,A Winters Tale,96.0,4.4.364,Servant,three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
110152,A Winters Tale,97.0,4.4.365,Shepherd,Leave your prating: since these good men are
110153,A Winters Tale,97.0,4.4.366,Shepherd,"pleased, let them come in, but quickly now."
110154,A Winters Tale,98.0,4.4.367,Servant,"Why, they stay at door, sir."
110155,A Winters Tale,98.0,,Servant,Exit
110156,A Winters Tale,98.0,,Servant,Here a dance of twelve Satyrs
110157,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.368,POLIXENES,"O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter."
110158,A Winters Tale,99.0,,POLIXENES,To CAMILLO
110159,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.369,POLIXENES,Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
110160,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.370,POLIXENES,He's simple and tells much.
110161,A Winters Tale,99.0,,POLIXENES,To FLORIZEL
110162,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.371,POLIXENES,"How now, fair shepherd!"
110163,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.372,POLIXENES,Your heart is full of something that does take
110164,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.373,POLIXENES,"Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young"
110165,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.374,POLIXENES,"And handed love as you do, I was wont"
110166,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.375,POLIXENES,To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
110167,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.376,POLIXENES,The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
110168,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.377,POLIXENES,"To her acceptance, you have let him go"
110169,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.378,POLIXENES,And nothing marted with him. If your lass
110170,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.379,POLIXENES,Interpretation should abuse and call this
110171,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.380,POLIXENES,"Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited"
110172,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.381,POLIXENES,"For a reply, at least if you make a care"
110173,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.382,POLIXENES,Of happy holding her.
110174,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.383,FLORIZEL,"Old sir, I know"
110175,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.384,FLORIZEL,She prizes not such trifles as these are:
110176,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.385,FLORIZEL,The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
110177,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.386,FLORIZEL,"Up in my heart, which I have given already,"
110178,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.387,FLORIZEL,"But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life"
110179,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.388,FLORIZEL,"Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,"
110180,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.389,FLORIZEL,"Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,"
110181,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.390,FLORIZEL,"As soft as dove's down and as white as it,"
110182,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.391,FLORIZEL,"Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd"
110183,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.392,FLORIZEL,snow that's bolted
110184,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.393,FLORIZEL,By the northern blasts twice o'er.
110185,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.394,POLIXENES,What follows this?
110186,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.395,POLIXENES,How prettily the young swain seems to wash
110187,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.396,POLIXENES,The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
110188,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.397,POLIXENES,"But to your protestation, let me hear"
110189,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.398,POLIXENES,What you profess.
110190,A Winters Tale,102.0,4.4.399,FLORIZEL,"Do, and be witness to 't."
110191,A Winters Tale,103.0,4.4.400,POLIXENES,And this my neighbour too?
110192,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.401,FLORIZEL,"And he, and more"
110193,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.402,FLORIZEL,"Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:"
110194,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.403,FLORIZEL,"That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,"
110195,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.404,FLORIZEL,"Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth"
110196,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.405,FLORIZEL,"That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge"
110197,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.406,FLORIZEL,"More than was ever man's, I would not prize them"
110198,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.407,FLORIZEL,"Without her love, for her employ them all,"
110199,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.408,FLORIZEL,Commend them and condemn them to her service
110200,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.409,FLORIZEL,Or to their own perdition.
110201,A Winters Tale,105.0,4.4.410,POLIXENES,Fairly offer'd.
110202,A Winters Tale,106.0,4.4.411,CAMILLO,This shows a sound affection.
110203,A Winters Tale,107.0,4.4.412,Shepherd,"But, my daughter,"
110204,A Winters Tale,107.0,4.4.413,Shepherd,Say you the like to him?
110205,A Winters Tale,108.0,4.4.414,PERDITA,I cannot speak
110206,A Winters Tale,108.0,4.4.415,PERDITA,"So well, nothing so well, no, nor mean better:"
110207,A Winters Tale,108.0,4.4.416,PERDITA,By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
110208,A Winters Tale,108.0,4.4.417,PERDITA,The purity of his.
110209,A Winters Tale,109.0,4.4.418,Shepherd,"Take hands, a bargain!"
110210,A Winters Tale,109.0,4.4.419,Shepherd,"And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:"
110211,A Winters Tale,109.0,4.4.420,Shepherd,"I give my daughter to him, and will make"
110212,A Winters Tale,109.0,4.4.421,Shepherd,Her portion equal his.
110213,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.422,FLORIZEL,"O, that must be"
110214,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.423,FLORIZEL,"I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,"
110215,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.424,FLORIZEL,"I shall have more than you can dream of yet,"
110216,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.425,FLORIZEL,"Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,"
110217,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.426,FLORIZEL,Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
110218,A Winters Tale,111.0,4.4.427,Shepherd,"Come, your hand,"
110219,A Winters Tale,111.0,4.4.428,Shepherd,"And, daughter, yours."
110220,A Winters Tale,112.0,4.4.429,POLIXENES,"Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you,"
110221,A Winters Tale,112.0,4.4.430,POLIXENES,Have you a father?
110222,A Winters Tale,113.0,4.4.431,FLORIZEL,I have: but what of him?
110223,A Winters Tale,114.0,4.4.432,POLIXENES,Knows he of this?
110224,A Winters Tale,115.0,4.4.433,FLORIZEL,He neither does nor shall.
110225,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.434,POLIXENES,Methinks a father
110226,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.435,POLIXENES,Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
110227,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.436,POLIXENES,"That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,"
110228,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.437,POLIXENES,Is not your father grown incapable
110229,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.438,POLIXENES,Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
110230,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.439,POLIXENES,With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
110231,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.440,POLIXENES,Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
110232,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.441,POLIXENES,Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
110233,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.442,POLIXENES,But what he did being childish?
110234,A Winters Tale,117.0,4.4.443,FLORIZEL,"No, good sir,"
110235,A Winters Tale,117.0,4.4.444,FLORIZEL,He has his health and ampler strength indeed
110236,A Winters Tale,117.0,4.4.445,FLORIZEL,Than most have of his age.
110237,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.446,POLIXENES,"By my white beard,"
110238,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.447,POLIXENES,"You offer him, if this be so, a wrong"
110239,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.448,POLIXENES,Something unfilial: reason my son
110240,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.449,POLIXENES,"Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason"
110241,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.450,POLIXENES,"The father, all whose joy is nothing else"
110242,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.451,POLIXENES,"But fair posterity, should hold some counsel"
110243,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.452,POLIXENES,In such a business.
110244,A Winters Tale,119.0,4.4.453,FLORIZEL,"I yield all this,"
110245,A Winters Tale,119.0,4.4.454,FLORIZEL,"But for some other reasons, my grave sir,"
110246,A Winters Tale,119.0,4.4.455,FLORIZEL,"Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint"
110247,A Winters Tale,119.0,4.4.456,FLORIZEL,My father of this business.
110248,A Winters Tale,120.0,4.4.457,POLIXENES,Let him know't.
110249,A Winters Tale,121.0,4.4.458,FLORIZEL,He shall not.
110250,A Winters Tale,122.0,4.4.459,POLIXENES,"Prithee, let him."
110251,A Winters Tale,123.0,4.4.460,FLORIZEL,"No, he must not."
110252,A Winters Tale,124.0,4.4.461,Shepherd,"Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve"
110253,A Winters Tale,124.0,4.4.462,Shepherd,At knowing of thy choice.
110254,A Winters Tale,125.0,4.4.463,FLORIZEL,"Come, come, he must not."
110255,A Winters Tale,125.0,4.4.464,FLORIZEL,Mark our contract.
110256,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.465,POLIXENES,"Mark your divorce, young sir,"
110257,A Winters Tale,126.0,,POLIXENES,Discovering himself
110258,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.466,POLIXENES,"Whom son I dare not call, thou art too base"
110259,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.467,POLIXENES,"To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,"
110260,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.468,POLIXENES,"That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,"
110261,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.469,POLIXENES,I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
110262,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.470,POLIXENES,"But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece"
110263,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.471,POLIXENES,"Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know"
110264,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.472,POLIXENES,"The royal fool thou copest with,--"
110265,A Winters Tale,127.0,4.4.473,Shepherd,"O, my heart!"
110266,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.474,POLIXENES,"I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made"
110267,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.475,POLIXENES,"More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,"
110268,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.476,POLIXENES,If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
110269,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.477,POLIXENES,"That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never"
110270,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.478,POLIXENES,"I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession,"
110271,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.479,POLIXENES,"Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,"
110272,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.480,POLIXENES,Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
110273,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.481,POLIXENES,"Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,"
110274,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.482,POLIXENES,"Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee"
110275,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.483,POLIXENES,"From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--"
110276,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.484,POLIXENES,"Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,"
110277,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.485,POLIXENES,"That makes himself, but for our honour therein,"
110278,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.486,POLIXENES,"Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou"
110279,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.487,POLIXENES,"These rural latches to his entrance open,"
110280,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.488,POLIXENES,"Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,"
110281,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.489,POLIXENES,I will devise a death as cruel for thee
110282,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.490,POLIXENES,As thou art tender to't.
110283,A Winters Tale,128.0,,POLIXENES,Exit
110284,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.491,PERDITA,Even here undone!
110285,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.492,PERDITA,"I was not much afeard, for once or twice"
110286,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.493,PERDITA,"I was about to speak and tell him plainly,"
110287,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.494,PERDITA,The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
110288,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.495,PERDITA,Hides not his visage from our cottage but
110289,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.496,PERDITA,"Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?"
110290,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.497,PERDITA,"I told you what would come of this: beseech you,"
110291,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.498,PERDITA,"Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--"
110292,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.499,PERDITA,"Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,"
110293,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.500,PERDITA,But milk my ewes and weep.
110294,A Winters Tale,130.0,4.4.501,CAMILLO,"Why, how now, father!"
110295,A Winters Tale,130.0,4.4.502,CAMILLO,Speak ere thou diest.
110296,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.503,Shepherd,"I cannot speak, nor think"
110297,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.504,Shepherd,Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
110298,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.505,Shepherd,"You have undone a man of fourscore three,"
110299,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.506,Shepherd,"That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,"
110300,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.507,Shepherd,"To die upon the bed my father died,"
110301,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.508,Shepherd,To lie close by his honest bones: but now
110302,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.509,Shepherd,Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
110303,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.510,Shepherd,"Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,"
110304,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.511,Shepherd,"That knew'st this was the prince,"
110305,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.512,Shepherd,and wouldst adventure
110306,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.513,Shepherd,To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
110307,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.514,Shepherd,"If I might die within this hour, I have lived"
110308,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.515,Shepherd,To die when I desire.
110309,A Winters Tale,131.0,,Shepherd,Exit
110310,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.516,FLORIZEL,Why look you so upon me?
110311,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.517,FLORIZEL,"I am but sorry, not afeard, delay'd,"
110312,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.518,FLORIZEL,"But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am,"
110313,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.519,FLORIZEL,"More straining on for plucking back, not following"
110314,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.520,FLORIZEL,My leash unwillingly.
110315,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.521,CAMILLO,"Gracious my lord,"
110316,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.522,CAMILLO,You know your father's temper: at this time
110317,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.523,CAMILLO,"He will allow no speech, which I do guess"
110318,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.524,CAMILLO,"You do not purpose to him, and as hardly"
110319,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.525,CAMILLO,"Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:"
110320,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.526,CAMILLO,"Then, till the fury of his highness settle,"
110321,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.527,CAMILLO,Come not before him.
110322,A Winters Tale,134.0,4.4.528,FLORIZEL,I not purpose it.
110323,A Winters Tale,134.0,4.4.529,FLORIZEL,"I think, Camillo?"
110324,A Winters Tale,135.0,4.4.530,CAMILLO,"Even he, my lord."
110325,A Winters Tale,136.0,4.4.531,PERDITA,How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
110326,A Winters Tale,136.0,4.4.532,PERDITA,"How often said, my dignity would last"
110327,A Winters Tale,136.0,4.4.533,PERDITA,But till 'twere known!
110328,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.534,FLORIZEL,It cannot fail but by
110329,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.535,FLORIZEL,"The violation of my faith, and then"
110330,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.536,FLORIZEL,Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
110331,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.537,FLORIZEL,And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
110332,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.538,FLORIZEL,"From my succession wipe me, father, I"
110333,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.539,FLORIZEL,Am heir to my affection.
110334,A Winters Tale,138.0,4.4.540,CAMILLO,Be advised.
110335,A Winters Tale,139.0,4.4.541,FLORIZEL,"I am, and by my fancy: if my reason"
110336,A Winters Tale,139.0,4.4.542,FLORIZEL,"Will thereto be obedient, I have reason,"
110337,A Winters Tale,139.0,4.4.543,FLORIZEL,"If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,"
110338,A Winters Tale,139.0,4.4.544,FLORIZEL,Do bid it welcome.
110339,A Winters Tale,140.0,4.4.545,CAMILLO,"This is desperate, sir."
110340,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.546,FLORIZEL,"So call it: but it does fulfil my vow,"
110341,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.547,FLORIZEL,"I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,"
110342,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.548,FLORIZEL,"Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may"
110343,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.549,FLORIZEL,"Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or"
110344,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.550,FLORIZEL,The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
110345,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.551,FLORIZEL,"In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath"
110346,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.552,FLORIZEL,"To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,"
110347,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.553,FLORIZEL,"As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,"
110348,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.554,FLORIZEL,"When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not"
110349,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.555,FLORIZEL,"To see him any more,--cast your good counsels"
110350,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.556,FLORIZEL,"Upon his passion, let myself and fortune"
110351,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.557,FLORIZEL,Tug for the time to come. This you may know
110352,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.558,FLORIZEL,"And so deliver, I am put to sea"
110353,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.559,FLORIZEL,"With her whom here I cannot hold on shore,"
110354,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.560,FLORIZEL,And most opportune to our need I have
110355,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.561,FLORIZEL,"A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared"
110356,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.562,FLORIZEL,For this design. What course I mean to hold
110357,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.563,FLORIZEL,"Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor"
110358,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.564,FLORIZEL,Concern me the reporting.
110359,A Winters Tale,142.0,4.4.565,CAMILLO,O my lord!
110360,A Winters Tale,142.0,4.4.566,CAMILLO,"I would your spirit were easier for advice,"
110361,A Winters Tale,142.0,4.4.567,CAMILLO,Or stronger for your need.
110362,A Winters Tale,143.0,4.4.568,FLORIZEL,"Hark, Perdita"
110363,A Winters Tale,143.0,,FLORIZEL,Drawing her aside
110364,A Winters Tale,143.0,4.4.569,FLORIZEL,I'll hear you by and by.
110365,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.570,CAMILLO,"He's irremoveable,"
110366,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.571,CAMILLO,"Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if"
110367,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.572,CAMILLO,"His going I could frame to serve my turn,"
110368,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.573,CAMILLO,"Save him from danger, do him love and honour,"
110369,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.574,CAMILLO,Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
110370,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.575,CAMILLO,"And that unhappy king, my master, whom"
110371,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.576,CAMILLO,I so much thirst to see.
110372,A Winters Tale,145.0,4.4.577,FLORIZEL,"Now, good Camillo,"
110373,A Winters Tale,145.0,4.4.578,FLORIZEL,I am so fraught with curious business that
110374,A Winters Tale,145.0,4.4.579,FLORIZEL,I leave out ceremony.
110375,A Winters Tale,146.0,4.4.580,CAMILLO,"Sir, I think"
110376,A Winters Tale,146.0,4.4.581,CAMILLO,"You have heard of my poor services, i' the love"
110377,A Winters Tale,146.0,4.4.582,CAMILLO,That I have borne your father?
110378,A Winters Tale,147.0,4.4.583,FLORIZEL,Very nobly
110379,A Winters Tale,147.0,4.4.584,FLORIZEL,Have you deserved: it is my father's music
110380,A Winters Tale,147.0,4.4.585,FLORIZEL,"To speak your deeds, not little of his care"
110381,A Winters Tale,147.0,4.4.586,FLORIZEL,To have them recompensed as thought on.
110382,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.587,CAMILLO,"Well, my lord,"
110383,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.588,CAMILLO,If you may please to think I love the king
110384,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.589,CAMILLO,"And through him what is nearest to him, which is"
110385,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.590,CAMILLO,"Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:"
110386,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.591,CAMILLO,If your more ponderous and settled project
110387,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.592,CAMILLO,"May suffer alteration, on mine honour,"
110388,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.593,CAMILLO,I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
110389,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.594,CAMILLO,"As shall become your highness, where you may"
110390,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.595,CAMILLO,"Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,"
110391,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.596,CAMILLO,"There's no disjunction to be made, but by--"
110392,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.597,CAMILLO,"As heavens forefend!--your ruin, marry her,"
110393,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.598,CAMILLO,"And, with my best endeavours in your absence,"
110394,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.599,CAMILLO,Your discontenting father strive to qualify
110395,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.600,CAMILLO,And bring him up to liking.
110396,A Winters Tale,149.0,4.4.601,FLORIZEL,"How, Camillo,"
110397,A Winters Tale,149.0,4.4.602,FLORIZEL,"May this, almost a miracle, be done?"
110398,A Winters Tale,149.0,4.4.603,FLORIZEL,That I may call thee something more than man
110399,A Winters Tale,149.0,4.4.604,FLORIZEL,And after that trust to thee.
110400,A Winters Tale,150.0,4.4.605,CAMILLO,Have you thought on
110401,A Winters Tale,150.0,4.4.606,CAMILLO,A place whereto you'll go?
110402,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.607,FLORIZEL,Not any yet:
110403,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.608,FLORIZEL,But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
110404,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.609,FLORIZEL,"To what we wildly do, so we profess"
110405,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.610,FLORIZEL,Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
110406,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.611,FLORIZEL,Of every wind that blows.
110407,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.612,CAMILLO,Then list to me:
110408,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.613,CAMILLO,"This follows, if you will not change your purpose"
110409,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.614,CAMILLO,"But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,"
110410,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.615,CAMILLO,"And there present yourself and your fair princess,"
110411,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.616,CAMILLO,"For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:"
110412,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.617,CAMILLO,She shall be habited as it becomes
110413,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.618,CAMILLO,The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
110414,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.619,CAMILLO,Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
110415,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.620,CAMILLO,"His welcomes forth, asks thee the son forgiveness,"
110416,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.621,CAMILLO,"As 'twere i' the father's person, kisses the hands"
110417,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.622,CAMILLO,"Of your fresh princess, o'er and o'er divides him"
110418,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.623,CAMILLO,"'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness, the one"
110419,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.624,CAMILLO,He chides to hell and bids the other grow
110420,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.625,CAMILLO,Faster than thought or time.
110421,A Winters Tale,153.0,4.4.626,FLORIZEL,"Worthy Camillo,"
110422,A Winters Tale,153.0,4.4.627,FLORIZEL,What colour for my visitation shall I
110423,A Winters Tale,153.0,4.4.628,FLORIZEL,Hold up before him?
110424,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.629,CAMILLO,Sent by the king your father
110425,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.630,CAMILLO,"To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,"
110426,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.631,CAMILLO,"The manner of your bearing towards him, with"
110427,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.632,CAMILLO,"What you as from your father shall deliver,"
110428,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.633,CAMILLO,"Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:"
110429,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.634,CAMILLO,The which shall point you forth at every sitting
110430,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.635,CAMILLO,"What you must say, that he shall not perceive"
110431,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.636,CAMILLO,But that you have your father's bosom there
110432,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.637,CAMILLO,And speak his very heart.
110433,A Winters Tale,155.0,4.4.638,FLORIZEL,I am bound to you:
110434,A Winters Tale,155.0,4.4.639,FLORIZEL,There is some sap in this.
110435,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.640,CAMILLO,A cause more promising
110436,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.641,CAMILLO,Than a wild dedication of yourselves
110437,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.642,CAMILLO,"To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain"
110438,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.643,CAMILLO,"To miseries enough, no hope to help you,"
110439,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.644,CAMILLO,"But as you shake off one to take another,"
110440,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.645,CAMILLO,"Nothing so certain as your anchors, who"
110441,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.646,CAMILLO,"Do their best office, if they can but stay you"
110442,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.647,CAMILLO,Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
110443,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.648,CAMILLO,"Prosperity's the very bond of love,"
110444,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.649,CAMILLO,Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
110445,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.650,CAMILLO,Affliction alters.
110446,A Winters Tale,157.0,4.4.651,PERDITA,One of these is true:
110447,A Winters Tale,157.0,4.4.652,PERDITA,"I think affliction may subdue the cheek,"
110448,A Winters Tale,157.0,4.4.653,PERDITA,But not take in the mind.
110449,A Winters Tale,158.0,4.4.654,CAMILLO,"Yea, say you so?"
110450,A Winters Tale,158.0,4.4.655,CAMILLO,There shall not at your father's house these
110451,A Winters Tale,158.0,4.4.656,CAMILLO,seven years
110452,A Winters Tale,158.0,4.4.657,CAMILLO,Be born another such.
110453,A Winters Tale,159.0,4.4.658,FLORIZEL,"My good Camillo,"
110454,A Winters Tale,159.0,4.4.659,FLORIZEL,She is as forward of her breeding as
110455,A Winters Tale,159.0,4.4.660,FLORIZEL,She is i' the rear our birth.
110456,A Winters Tale,160.0,4.4.661,CAMILLO,I cannot say 'tis pity
110457,A Winters Tale,160.0,4.4.662,CAMILLO,"She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress"
110458,A Winters Tale,160.0,4.4.663,CAMILLO,To most that teach.
110459,A Winters Tale,161.0,4.4.664,PERDITA,"Your pardon, sir, for this"
110460,A Winters Tale,161.0,4.4.665,PERDITA,I'll blush you thanks.
110461,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.666,FLORIZEL,My prettiest Perdita!
110462,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.667,FLORIZEL,"But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,"
110463,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.668,FLORIZEL,"Preserver of my father, now of me,"
110464,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.669,FLORIZEL,"The medicine of our house, how shall we do?"
110465,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.670,FLORIZEL,"We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,"
110466,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.671,FLORIZEL,Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
110467,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.672,CAMILLO,"My lord,"
110468,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.673,CAMILLO,Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
110469,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.674,CAMILLO,Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
110470,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.675,CAMILLO,To have you royally appointed as if
110471,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.676,CAMILLO,"The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,"
110472,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.677,CAMILLO,"That you may know you shall not want, one word."
110473,A Winters Tale,163.0,,CAMILLO,They talk aside
110474,A Winters Tale,163.0,,CAMILLO,Re-enter AUTOLYCUS
110475,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.678,AUTOLYCUS,"Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his"
110476,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.679,AUTOLYCUS,"sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold"
110477,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.680,AUTOLYCUS,"all my trumpery, not a counterfeit stone, not a"
110478,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.681,AUTOLYCUS,"ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,"

110480,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.683,AUTOLYCUS,to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
110481,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.684,AUTOLYCUS,"should buy first, as if my trinkets had been"
110482,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.685,AUTOLYCUS,hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
110483,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.686,AUTOLYCUS,by which means I saw whose purse was best in

110485,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.688,AUTOLYCUS,"remembered. My clown, who wants but something to"
110486,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.689,AUTOLYCUS,"be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the"
110487,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.690,AUTOLYCUS,"wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes"
110488,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.691,AUTOLYCUS,"till he had both tune and words, which so drew the"

110490,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.693,AUTOLYCUS,"stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it"
110491,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.694,AUTOLYCUS,"was senseless, 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a"
110492,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.695,AUTOLYCUS,"purse, I could have filed keys off that hung in"
110493,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.696,AUTOLYCUS,"chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,"
110494,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.697,AUTOLYCUS,and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
110495,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.698,AUTOLYCUS,time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
110496,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.699,AUTOLYCUS,"festival purses, and had not the old man come in"
110497,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.700,AUTOLYCUS,with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's

110499,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.702,AUTOLYCUS,left a purse alive in the whole army.
110500,A Winters Tale,164.0,,AUTOLYCUS,"CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward"
110501,A Winters Tale,165.0,4.4.703,CAMILLO,"Nay, but my letters, by this means being there"
110502,A Winters Tale,165.0,4.4.704,CAMILLO,"So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt."
110503,A Winters Tale,166.0,4.4.705,FLORIZEL,And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
110504,A Winters Tale,167.0,4.4.706,CAMILLO,Shall satisfy your father.
110505,A Winters Tale,168.0,4.4.707,PERDITA,Happy be you!
110506,A Winters Tale,168.0,4.4.708,PERDITA,All that you speak shows fair.
110507,A Winters Tale,169.0,4.4.709,CAMILLO,Who have we here?
110508,A Winters Tale,169.0,,CAMILLO,Seeing AUTOLYCUS
110509,A Winters Tale,169.0,4.4.710,CAMILLO,"We'll make an instrument of this, omit"
110510,A Winters Tale,169.0,4.4.711,CAMILLO,Nothing may give us aid.
110511,A Winters Tale,170.0,4.4.712,AUTOLYCUS,"If they have overheard me now, why, hanging."
110512,A Winters Tale,171.0,4.4.713,CAMILLO,"How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear"
110513,A Winters Tale,171.0,4.4.714,CAMILLO,"not, man, here's no harm intended to thee."
110514,A Winters Tale,172.0,4.4.715,AUTOLYCUS,"I am a poor fellow, sir."
110515,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.716,CAMILLO,"Why, be so still, here's nobody will steal that from"
110516,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.717,CAMILLO,thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
110517,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.718,CAMILLO,"make an exchange, therefore discase thee instantly,"
110518,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.719,CAMILLO,"--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and"
110519,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.720,CAMILLO,change garments with this gentleman: though the

110521,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.722,CAMILLO,there's some boot.
110522,A Winters Tale,174.0,4.4.723,AUTOLYCUS,"I am a poor fellow, sir."
110523,A Winters Tale,174.0,,AUTOLYCUS,Aside

110526,A Winters Tale,175.0,4.4.726,CAMILLO,flayed already.
110527,A Winters Tale,176.0,4.4.727,AUTOLYCUS,"Are you in earnest, sir?"
110528,A Winters Tale,176.0,,AUTOLYCUS,Aside
110529,A Winters Tale,176.0,4.4.728,AUTOLYCUS,I smell the trick on't.
110530,A Winters Tale,177.0,4.4.729,FLORIZEL,"Dispatch, I prithee."
110531,A Winters Tale,178.0,4.4.730,AUTOLYCUS,"Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with"
110532,A Winters Tale,178.0,4.4.731,AUTOLYCUS,conscience take it.
110533,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.732,CAMILLO,"Unbuckle, unbuckle."

110732,A Winters Tale,240.0,4.4.925,AUTOLYCUS,complaint they have to the king concerns him
110733,A Winters Tale,240.0,4.4.926,AUTOLYCUS,"nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far"
110734,A Winters Tale,240.0,4.4.927,AUTOLYCUS,"officious, for I am proof against that title and"
110735,A Winters Tale,240.0,4.4.928,AUTOLYCUS,what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
110736,A Winters Tale,240.0,4.4.929,AUTOLYCUS,them: there may be matter in it.
110737,A Winters Tale,240.0,,AUTOLYCUS,Exit
110738,A Winters Tale,240.0,,AUTOLYCUS,ACT V
110739,A Winters Tale,240.0,,AUTOLYCUS,SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
110740,A Winters Tale,240.0,,AUTOLYCUS,"Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants"
110741,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.1.1,CLEOMENES,"Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd"
110742,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.1.2,CLEOMENES,"A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,"
110743,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.1.3,CLEOMENES,"Which you have not redeem'd, indeed, paid down"
110744,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.1.4,CLEOMENES,"More penitence than done trespass: at the last,"
110745,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.1.5,CLEOMENES,"Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil,"
110746,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.1.6,CLEOMENES,With them forgive yourself.
110747,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.1.7,LEONTES,Whilst I remember
110748,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.1.8,LEONTES,"Her and her virtues, I cannot forget"
110749,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.1.9,LEONTES,"My blemishes in them, and so still think of"
110750,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.1.10,LEONTES,"The wrong I did myself, which was so much,"
110751,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.1.11,LEONTES,That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
110752,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.1.12,LEONTES,Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
110753,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.1.13,LEONTES,Bred his hopes out of.
110754,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.1.14,PAULINA,"True, too true, my lord:"
110755,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.1.15,PAULINA,"If, one by one, you wedded all the world,"
110756,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.1.16,PAULINA,"Or from the all that are took something good,"
110757,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.1.17,PAULINA,"To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd"
110758,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.1.18,PAULINA,Would be unparallel'd.
110759,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.1.19,LEONTES,I think so. Kill'd!
110760,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.1.20,LEONTES,She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
110761,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.1.21,LEONTES,"Sorely, to say I did, it is as bitter"
110762,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.1.22,LEONTES,"Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,"
110763,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.1.23,LEONTES,Say so but seldom.
110764,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.1.24,CLEOMENES,"Not at all, good lady:"
110765,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.1.25,CLEOMENES,You might have spoken a thousand things that would
110766,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.1.26,CLEOMENES,Have done the time more benefit and graced
110767,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.1.27,CLEOMENES,Your kindness better.
110768,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.1.28,PAULINA,You are one of those
110769,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.1.29,PAULINA,Would have him wed again.
110770,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.30,DION,"If you would not so,"
110771,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.31,DION,"You pity not the state, nor the remembrance"
110772,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.32,DION,"Of his most sovereign name, consider little"
110773,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.33,DION,"What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,"
110774,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.34,DION,May drop upon his kingdom and devour
110775,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.35,DION,Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
110776,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.36,DION,Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
110777,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.37,DION,"What holier than, for royalty's repair,"
110778,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.38,DION,"For present comfort and for future good,"
110779,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.39,DION,To bless the bed of majesty again
110780,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.40,DION,With a sweet fellow to't?
110781,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.41,PAULINA,"There is none worthy,"
110782,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.42,PAULINA,"Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods"
110783,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.43,PAULINA,"Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes,"
110784,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.44,PAULINA,"For has not the divine Apollo said,"
110785,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.45,PAULINA,"Is't not the tenor of his oracle,"
110786,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.46,PAULINA,That King Leontes shall not have an heir
110787,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.47,PAULINA,"Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,"
110788,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.48,PAULINA,Is all as monstrous to our human reason
110789,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.49,PAULINA,As my Antigonus to break his grave
110790,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.50,PAULINA,"And come again to me, who, on my life,"
110791,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.51,PAULINA,Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
110792,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.52,PAULINA,"My lord should to the heavens be contrary,"
110793,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.53,PAULINA,Oppose against their wills.
110794,A Winters Tale,8.0,,PAULINA,To LEONTES
110795,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.54,PAULINA,"Care not for issue,"
110796,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.55,PAULINA,The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
110797,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.56,PAULINA,"Left his to the worthiest, so his successor"
110798,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.1.57,PAULINA,Was like to be the best.
110799,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.1.58,LEONTES,"Good Paulina,"
110800,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.1.59,LEONTES,"Who hast the memory of Hermione,"
110801,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.1.60,LEONTES,"I know, in honour, O, that ever I"
110802,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.1.61,LEONTES,"Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,"
110803,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.1.62,LEONTES,"I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,"
110804,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.1.63,LEONTES,Have taken treasure from her lips--
110805,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.1.64,PAULINA,And left them
110806,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.1.65,PAULINA,More rich for what they yielded.
110807,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.1.66,LEONTES,Thou speak'st truth.
110808,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.1.67,LEONTES,"No more such wives, therefore, no wife: one worse,"
110809,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.1.68,LEONTES,"And better used, would make her sainted spirit"
110810,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.1.69,LEONTES,"Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,"
110811,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.1.70,LEONTES,"Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,"
110812,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.1.71,LEONTES,"And begin, 'Why to me?'"
110813,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.1.72,PAULINA,"Had she such power,"
110814,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.1.73,PAULINA,She had just cause.
110815,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.1.74,LEONTES,"She had, and would incense me"
110816,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.1.75,LEONTES,To murder her I married.
110817,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.76,PAULINA,I should so.
110818,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.77,PAULINA,"Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark"
110819,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.78,PAULINA,"Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't"
110820,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.79,PAULINA,"You chose her, then I'ld shriek, that even your ears"
110821,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.80,PAULINA,"Should rift to hear me, and the words that follow'd"
110822,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.81,PAULINA,Should be 'Remember mine.'
110823,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.1.82,LEONTES,"Stars, stars,"
110824,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.1.83,LEONTES,"And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife,"
110825,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.1.84,LEONTES,"I'll have no wife, Paulina."
110826,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.1.85,PAULINA,Will you swear
110827,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.1.86,PAULINA,Never to marry but by my free leave?
110828,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.1.87,LEONTES,"Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit!"
110829,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.1.88,PAULINA,"Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath."
110830,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.1.89,CLEOMENES,You tempt him over-much.
110831,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.1.90,PAULINA,"Unless another,"
110832,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.1.91,PAULINA,"As like Hermione as is her picture,"
110833,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.1.92,PAULINA,Affront his eye.
110834,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.1.93,CLEOMENES,"Good madam,--"
110835,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.94,PAULINA,I have done.
110836,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.95,PAULINA,"Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,"
110837,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.96,PAULINA,"No remedy, but you will,--give me the office"
110838,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.97,PAULINA,To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
110839,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.98,PAULINA,"As was your former, but she shall be such"
110840,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.99,PAULINA,"As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,"
110841,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.100,PAULINA,it should take joy
110842,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.101,PAULINA,To see her in your arms.
110843,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.1.102,LEONTES,"My true Paulina,"
110844,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.1.103,LEONTES,We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
110845,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.1.104,PAULINA,That
110846,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.1.105,PAULINA,"Shall be when your first queen's again in breath,"
110847,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.1.106,PAULINA,Never till then.
110848,A Winters Tale,24.0,,PAULINA,Enter a Gentleman
110849,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.1.107,Gentleman,"One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,"
110850,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.1.108,Gentleman,"Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she"
110851,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.1.109,Gentleman,"The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access"
110852,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.1.110,Gentleman,To your high presence.
110853,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.111,LEONTES,What with him? he comes not
110854,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.112,LEONTES,"Like to his father's greatness: his approach,"
110855,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.113,LEONTES,"So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us"
110856,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.114,LEONTES,"'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced"
110857,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.115,LEONTES,By need and accident. What train?
110858,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.1.116,Gentleman,"But few,"
110859,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.1.117,Gentleman,And those but mean.
110860,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.1.118,LEONTES,"His princess, say you, with him?"
110861,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.1.119,Gentleman,"Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,"
110862,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.1.120,Gentleman,That e'er the sun shone bright on.
110863,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.121,PAULINA,"O Hermione,"
110864,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.122,PAULINA,As every present time doth boast itself
110865,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.123,PAULINA,"Above a better gone, so must thy grave"
110866,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.124,PAULINA,"Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself"
110867,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.125,PAULINA,"Have said and writ so, but your writing now"
110868,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.126,PAULINA,"Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,"
110869,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.127,PAULINA,"Nor was not to be equall'd,'--thus your verse"
110870,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.128,PAULINA,"Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,"
110871,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.129,PAULINA,To say you have seen a better.
110872,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.130,Gentleman,"Pardon, madam:"
110873,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.131,Gentleman,"The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--"
110874,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.132,Gentleman,"The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,"
110875,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.133,Gentleman,"Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,"
110876,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.134,Gentleman,"Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal"
110877,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.135,Gentleman,"Of all professors else, make proselytes"
110878,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.136,Gentleman,Of who she but bid follow.
110879,A Winters Tale,32.0,5.1.137,PAULINA,How! not women?
110880,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.1.138,Gentleman,"Women will love her, that she is a woman"
110881,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.1.139,Gentleman,"More worth than any man, men, that she is"
110882,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.1.140,Gentleman,The rarest of all women.
110883,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.1.141,LEONTES,"Go, Cleomenes,"
110884,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.1.142,LEONTES,"Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,"
110885,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.1.143,LEONTES,"Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange"
110886,A Winters Tale,34.0,,LEONTES,Exeunt CLEOMENES and others
110887,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.1.144,LEONTES,He thus should steal upon us.
110888,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.1.145,PAULINA,"Had our prince,"
110889,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.1.146,PAULINA,"Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd"
110890,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.1.147,PAULINA,Well with this lord: there was not full a month
110891,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.1.148,PAULINA,Between their births.
110892,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.149,LEONTES,"Prithee, no more, cease, thou know'st"
110893,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.150,LEONTES,"He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,"
110894,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.151,LEONTES,"When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches"
110895,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.152,LEONTES,Will bring me to consider that which may
110896,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.153,LEONTES,Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
110897,A Winters Tale,36.0,,LEONTES,"Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA"
110898,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.154,LEONTES,"Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,"
110899,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.155,LEONTES,"For she did print your royal father off,"
110900,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.156,LEONTES,"Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,"
110901,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.157,LEONTES,"Your father's image is so hit in you,"
110902,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.158,LEONTES,"His very air, that I should call you brother,"
110903,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.159,LEONTES,"As I did him, and speak of something wildly"
110904,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.160,LEONTES,By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
110905,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.161,LEONTES,"And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!"
110906,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.162,LEONTES,"I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth"
110907,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.163,LEONTES,Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
110908,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.164,LEONTES,"You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--"
110909,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.165,LEONTES,"All mine own folly--the society,"
110910,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.166,LEONTES,"Amity too, of your brave father, whom,"
110911,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.167,LEONTES,"Though bearing misery, I desire my life"
110912,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.168,LEONTES,Once more to look on him.
110913,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.169,FLORIZEL,By his command
110914,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.170,FLORIZEL,Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
110915,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.171,FLORIZEL,"Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,"
110916,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.172,FLORIZEL,"Can send his brother: and, but infirmity"
110917,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.173,FLORIZEL,Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
110918,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.174,FLORIZEL,"His wish'd ability, he had himself"
110919,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.175,FLORIZEL,The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
110920,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.176,FLORIZEL,"Measured to look upon you, whom he loves--"
110921,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.177,FLORIZEL,He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
110922,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.178,FLORIZEL,And those that bear them living.
110923,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.179,LEONTES,"O my brother,"
110924,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.180,LEONTES,Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
110925,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.181,LEONTES,"Afresh within me, and these thy offices,"
110926,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.182,LEONTES,"So rarely kind, are as interpreters"
110927,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.183,LEONTES,"Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,"
110928,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.184,LEONTES,As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
110929,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.185,LEONTES,"Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,"
110930,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.186,LEONTES,"At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,"
110931,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.187,LEONTES,"To greet a man not worth her pains, much less"
110932,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.188,LEONTES,The adventure of her person?
110933,A Winters Tale,39.0,5.1.189,FLORIZEL,"Good my lord,"
110934,A Winters Tale,39.0,5.1.190,FLORIZEL,She came from Libya.
110935,A Winters Tale,40.0,5.1.191,LEONTES,"Where the warlike Smalus,"
110936,A Winters Tale,40.0,5.1.192,LEONTES,"That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?"
110937,A Winters Tale,41.0,5.1.193,FLORIZEL,"Most royal sir, from thence, from him, whose daughter"
110938,A Winters Tale,41.0,5.1.194,FLORIZEL,"His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,"

111014,A Winters Tale,57.0,5.1.269,LEONTES,Which he counts but a trifle.

111021,A Winters Tale,59.0,,LEONTES,To FLORIZEL

111023,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.277,LEONTES,Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
111024,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.278,LEONTES,"Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,"
111025,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.279,LEONTES,I am friend to them and you: upon which errand

111031,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.2.1,AUTOLYCUS,"Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?"
111032,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.2,First Gentleman,"I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old"
111033,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.3,First Gentleman,shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
111034,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.4,First Gentleman,"whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all"
111035,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.5,First Gentleman,"commanded out of the chamber, only this methought I"
111036,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.6,First Gentleman,"heard the shepherd say, he found the child."
111037,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.2.7,AUTOLYCUS,I would most gladly know the issue of it.
111038,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.8,First Gentleman,"I make a broken delivery of the business, but the"
111039,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.9,First Gentleman,changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
111040,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.10,First Gentleman,"very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with"
111041,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.11,First Gentleman,"staring on one another, to tear the cases of their"
111042,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.12,First Gentleman,"eyes, there was speech in their dumbness, language"

111046,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.16,First Gentleman,"beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not"
111047,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.17,First Gentleman,"say if the importance were joy or sorrow, but in the"

111049,A Winters Tale,4.0,,First Gentleman,Enter another Gentleman
111050,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.19,First Gentleman,Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
111051,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.20,First Gentleman,"The news, Rogero?"
111052,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.21,Second Gentleman,"Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled, the"
111053,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.22,Second Gentleman,king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
111054,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.23,Second Gentleman,broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
111055,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.24,Second Gentleman,cannot be able to express it.
111056,A Winters Tale,5.0,,Second Gentleman,Enter a third Gentleman
111057,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.25,Second Gentleman,Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
111058,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.26,Second Gentleman,"deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news"
111059,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.27,Second Gentleman,"which is called true is so like an old tale, that"
111060,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.28,Second Gentleman,the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
111061,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.29,Second Gentleman,found his heir?
111062,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.30,Third Gentleman,"Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by"
111063,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.31,Third Gentleman,circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
111064,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.32,Third Gentleman,"see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle"
111065,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.33,Third Gentleman,"of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,"
111066,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.34,Third Gentleman,the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
111067,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.35,Third Gentleman,"know to be his character, the majesty of the"
111068,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.36,Third Gentleman,"creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection"
111069,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.37,Third Gentleman,"of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,"
111070,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.38,Third Gentleman,and many other evidences proclaim her with all
111071,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.39,Third Gentleman,certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
111072,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.40,Third Gentleman,the meeting of the two kings?
111073,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.2.41,Second Gentleman,No.
111074,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.42,Third Gentleman,"Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,"
111075,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.43,Third Gentleman,cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
111076,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.44,Third Gentleman,"joy crown another, so and in such manner that it"
111077,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.45,Third Gentleman,"seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their"
111078,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.46,Third Gentleman,"joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,"
111079,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.47,Third Gentleman,"holding up of hands, with countenances of such"
111080,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.48,Third Gentleman,"distraction that they were to be known by garment,"
111081,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.49,Third Gentleman,"not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of"
111082,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.50,Third Gentleman,"himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that"
111083,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.51,Third Gentleman,"joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,"
111084,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.52,Third Gentleman,"thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness, then"
111085,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.53,Third Gentleman,"embraces his son-in-law, then again worries he his"
111086,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.54,Third Gentleman,"daughter with clipping her, now he thanks the old"
111087,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.55,Third Gentleman,"shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten"
111088,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.56,Third Gentleman,conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
111089,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.57,Third Gentleman,"another encounter, which lames report to follow it"
111090,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.58,Third Gentleman,and undoes description to do it.
111091,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.2.59,Second Gentleman,"What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried"
111092,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.2.60,Second Gentleman,hence the child?
111093,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.61,Third Gentleman,"Like an old tale still, which will have matter to"
111094,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.62,Third Gentleman,"rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear"
111095,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.63,Third Gentleman,open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
111096,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.64,Third Gentleman,"avouches the shepherd's son, who has not only his"
111097,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.65,Third Gentleman,"innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a"
111098,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.66,Third Gentleman,handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
111099,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.2.67,First Gentleman,What became of his bark and his followers?
111100,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.68,Third Gentleman,Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
111101,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.69,Third Gentleman,in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
111102,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.70,Third Gentleman,instruments which aided to expose the child were
111103,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.71,Third Gentleman,"even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble"
111104,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.72,Third Gentleman,combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
111105,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.73,Third Gentleman,Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
111106,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.74,Third Gentleman,"her husband, another elevated that the oracle was"
111107,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.75,Third Gentleman,"fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,"
111108,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.76,Third Gentleman,"and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin"
111109,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.77,Third Gentleman,her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
111110,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.78,Third Gentleman,of losing.
111111,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.2.79,First Gentleman,The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
111112,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.2.80,First Gentleman,"kings and princes, for by such was it acted."
111113,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.81,Third Gentleman,One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
111114,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.82,Third Gentleman,"angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not"
111115,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.83,Third Gentleman,"the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's"
111116,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.84,Third Gentleman,"death, with the manner how she came to't bravely"
111117,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.85,Third Gentleman,"confessed and lamented by the king, how"
111118,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.86,Third Gentleman,"attentiveness wounded his daughter, till, from one"
111119,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.87,Third Gentleman,"sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'"
111120,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.88,Third Gentleman,"I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my"
111121,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.89,Third Gentleman,heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
111122,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.90,Third Gentleman,"colour, some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world"
111123,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.91,Third Gentleman,"could have seen 't, the woe had been universal."
111124,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.2.92,First Gentleman,Are they returned to the court?
111125,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.2.93,Third Gentleman,"No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,"
111126,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.2.94,Third Gentleman,"which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many"
111127,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.2.95,Third Gentleman,years in doing and now newly performed by that rare

111134,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.2.102,Third Gentleman,"are they gone, and there they intend to sup."
111135,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.2.103,Second Gentleman,"I thought she had some great matter there in hand,"
111136,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.2.104,Second Gentleman,"for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever"

111141,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.2.109,First Gentleman,every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
111142,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.2.110,First Gentleman,our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
111143,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.2.111,First Gentleman,Let's along.

111146,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.113,AUTOLYCUS,would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old

111148,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.115,AUTOLYCUS,them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
111149,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.116,AUTOLYCUS,"at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,"
111150,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.117,AUTOLYCUS,"so he then took her to be, who began to be much"
111151,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.118,AUTOLYCUS,"sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of"
111152,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.119,AUTOLYCUS,"weather continuing, this mystery remained"
111153,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.120,AUTOLYCUS,"undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me, for had I"
111154,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.121,AUTOLYCUS,"been the finder out of this secret, it would not"
111155,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.122,AUTOLYCUS,have relished among my other discredits.
111156,A Winters Tale,19.0,,AUTOLYCUS,Enter Shepherd and Clown
111157,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.123,AUTOLYCUS,"Here come those I have done good to against my will,"
111158,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.124,AUTOLYCUS,and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
111159,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.2.125,Shepherd,"Come, boy, I am past moe children, but thy sons and"
111160,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.2.126,Shepherd,daughters will be all gentlemen born.
111161,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.127,Clown,"You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me"
111162,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.128,Clown,"this other day, because I was no gentleman born."
111163,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.129,Clown,See you these clothes? say you see them not and
111164,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.130,Clown,think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
111165,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.131,Clown,these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
111166,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.132,Clown,"lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born."
111167,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.2.133,AUTOLYCUS,"I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born."
111168,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.2.134,Clown,"Ay, and have been so any time these four hours."
111169,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.2.135,Shepherd,"And so have I, boy."
111170,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.136,Clown,So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
111171,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.137,Clown,"father, for the king's son took me by the hand, and"
111172,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.138,Clown,"called me brother, and then the two kings called my"
111173,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.139,Clown,"father brother, and then the prince my brother and"
111174,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.140,Clown,"the princess my sister called my father father, and"
111175,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.141,Clown,"so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like"
111176,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.142,Clown,tears that ever we shed.
111177,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.2.143,Shepherd,"We may live, son, to shed many more."
111178,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.2.144,Clown,"Ay, or else 'twere hard luck, being in so"
111179,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.2.145,Clown,preposterous estate as we are.
111180,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.2.146,AUTOLYCUS,"I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the"
111181,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.2.147,AUTOLYCUS,faults I have committed to your worship and to give
111182,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.2.148,AUTOLYCUS,me your good report to the prince my master.
111183,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.2.149,Shepherd,"Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle, now we are"
111184,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.2.150,Shepherd,gentlemen.
111185,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.2.151,Clown,Thou wilt amend thy life?
111186,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.2.152,AUTOLYCUS,"Ay, an it like your good worship."
111187,A Winters Tale,32.0,5.2.153,Clown,Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
111188,A Winters Tale,32.0,5.2.154,Clown,art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
111189,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.2.155,Shepherd,"You may say it, but not swear it."
111190,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.2.156,Clown,"Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and"
111191,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.2.157,Clown,"franklins say it, I'll swear it."
111192,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.2.158,Shepherd,"How if it be false, son?"
111193,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.159,Clown,"If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear"
111194,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.160,Clown,it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
111195,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.161,Clown,the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
111196,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.162,Clown,"that thou wilt not be drunk, but I know thou art no"
111197,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.163,Clown,tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
111198,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.164,Clown,"drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst"
111199,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.165,Clown,be a tall fellow of thy hands.
111200,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.2.166,AUTOLYCUS,"I will prove so, sir, to my power."
111201,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.167,Clown,"Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not"
111202,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.168,Clown,"wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not"
111203,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.169,Clown,"being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings"
111204,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.170,Clown,"and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the"
111205,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.171,Clown,"queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy"
111206,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.172,Clown,good masters.
111207,A Winters Tale,38.0,,Clown,Exeunt
111208,A Winters Tale,38.0,,Clown,SCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.
111209,A Winters Tale,38.0,,Clown,"Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants"
111210,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.3.1,LEONTES,"O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort"
111211,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.3.2,LEONTES,That I have had of thee!
111212,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.3,PAULINA,"What, sovereign sir,"
111213,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.4,PAULINA,I did not well I meant well. All my services
111214,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.5,PAULINA,"You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,"
111215,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.6,PAULINA,With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
111216,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.7,PAULINA,"Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,"
111217,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.8,PAULINA,"It is a surplus of your grace, which never"
111218,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.9,PAULINA,My life may last to answer.
111219,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.10,LEONTES,"O Paulina,"
111220,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.11,LEONTES,We honour you with trouble: but we came
111221,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.12,LEONTES,To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
111222,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.13,LEONTES,"Have we pass'd through, not without much content"
111223,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.14,LEONTES,"In many singularities, but we saw not"
111224,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.15,LEONTES,"That which my daughter came to look upon,"
111225,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.16,LEONTES,The statue of her mother.
111226,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.17,PAULINA,"As she lived peerless,"
111227,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.18,PAULINA,"So her dead likeness, I do well believe,"
111228,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.19,PAULINA,Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
111229,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.20,PAULINA,"Or hand of man hath done, therefore I keep it"
111230,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.21,PAULINA,"Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare"
111231,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.22,PAULINA,To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
111232,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.23,PAULINA,"Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well."
111233,A Winters Tale,4.0,,PAULINA,"PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue"
111234,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.24,PAULINA,"I like your silence, it the more shows off"
111235,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.25,PAULINA,"Your wonder: but yet speak, first, you, my liege,"
111236,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.26,PAULINA,Comes it not something near?
111237,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.27,LEONTES,Her natural posture!
111238,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.28,LEONTES,"Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed"
111239,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.29,LEONTES,"Thou art Hermione, or rather, thou art she"
111240,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.30,LEONTES,"In thy not chiding, for she was as tender"
111241,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.31,LEONTES,"As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,"
111242,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.32,LEONTES,"Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing"
111243,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.33,LEONTES,So aged as this seems.
111244,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.3.34,POLIXENES,"O, not by much."
111245,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.3.35,PAULINA,"So much the more our carver's excellence,"
111246,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.3.36,PAULINA,Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
111247,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.3.37,PAULINA,As she lived now.
111248,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.38,LEONTES,"As now she might have done,"
111249,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.39,LEONTES,"So much to my good comfort, as it is"
111250,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.40,LEONTES,"Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,"
111251,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.41,LEONTES,"Even with such life of majesty, warm life,"
111252,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.42,LEONTES,"As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!"
111253,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.43,LEONTES,I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
111254,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.44,LEONTES,"For being more stone than it? O royal piece,"
111255,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.45,LEONTES,"There's magic in thy majesty, which has"
111256,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.46,LEONTES,My evils conjured to remembrance and
111257,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.47,LEONTES,"From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,"
111258,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.48,LEONTES,Standing like stone with thee.
111259,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.49,PERDITA,"And give me leave,"
111260,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.50,PERDITA,"And do not say 'tis superstition, that"
111261,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.51,PERDITA,"I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,"
111262,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.52,PERDITA,"Dear queen, that ended when I but began,"
111263,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.53,PERDITA,Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
111264,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.3.54,PAULINA,"O, patience!"
111265,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.3.55,PAULINA,"The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry."
111266,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.56,CAMILLO,"My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,"
111267,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.57,CAMILLO,"Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,"
111268,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.58,CAMILLO,"So many summers dry, scarce any joy"
111269,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.59,CAMILLO,"Did ever so long live, no sorrow"
111270,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.60,CAMILLO,But kill'd itself much sooner.
111271,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.3.61,POLIXENES,"Dear my brother,"
111272,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.3.62,POLIXENES,Let him that was the cause of this have power
111273,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.3.63,POLIXENES,To take off so much grief from you as he
111274,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.3.64,POLIXENES,Will piece up in himself.
111275,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.3.65,PAULINA,"Indeed, my lord,"
111276,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.3.66,PAULINA,If I had thought the sight of my poor image
111277,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.3.67,PAULINA,"Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--"
111278,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.3.68,PAULINA,I'ld not have show'd it.
111279,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.3.69,LEONTES,Do not draw the curtain.
111280,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.3.70,PAULINA,"No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy"
111281,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.3.71,PAULINA,May think anon it moves.
111282,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.72,LEONTES,"Let be, let be."
111283,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.73,LEONTES,"Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--"
111284,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.74,LEONTES,"What was he that did make it? See, my lord,"
111285,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.75,LEONTES,Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
111286,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.76,LEONTES,Did verily bear blood?
111287,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.3.77,POLIXENES,Masterly done:
111288,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.3.78,POLIXENES,The very life seems warm upon her lip.
111289,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.3.79,LEONTES,"The fixture of her eye has motion in't,"
111290,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.3.80,LEONTES,As we are mock'd with art.
111291,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.3.81,PAULINA,I'll draw the curtain:
111292,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.3.82,PAULINA,My lord's almost so far transported that
111293,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.3.83,PAULINA,He'll think anon it lives.
111294,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.3.84,LEONTES,"O sweet Paulina,"
111295,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.3.85,LEONTES,Make me to think so twenty years together!
111296,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.3.86,LEONTES,No settled senses of the world can match
111297,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.3.87,LEONTES,The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
111298,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.3.88,PAULINA,"I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but"
111299,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.3.89,PAULINA,I could afflict you farther.
111300,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.90,LEONTES,"Do, Paulina,"
111301,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.91,LEONTES,For this affliction has a taste as sweet
111302,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.92,LEONTES,"As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,"
111303,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.93,LEONTES,There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
111304,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.94,LEONTES,"Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,"
111305,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.95,LEONTES,For I will kiss her.
111306,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.3.96,PAULINA,"Good my lord, forbear:"
111307,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.3.97,PAULINA,"The ruddiness upon her lip is wet,"
111308,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.3.98,PAULINA,"You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own"
111309,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.3.99,PAULINA,With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
111310,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.3.100,LEONTES,"No, not these twenty years."
111311,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.3.101,PERDITA,So long could I
111312,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.3.102,PERDITA,"Stand by, a looker on."
111313,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.103,PAULINA,"Either forbear,"
111314,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.104,PAULINA,"Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you"
111315,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.105,PAULINA,"For more amazement. If you can behold it,"
111316,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.106,PAULINA,"I'll make the statue move indeed, descend"
111317,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.107,PAULINA,"And take you by the hand, but then you'll think--"
111318,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.108,PAULINA,Which I protest against--I am assisted
111319,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.109,PAULINA,By wicked powers.
111320,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.3.110,LEONTES,"What you can make her do,"
111321,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.3.111,LEONTES,"I am content to look on: what to speak,"
111322,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.3.112,LEONTES,"I am content to hear, for 'tis as easy"
111323,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.3.113,LEONTES,To make her speak as move.
111324,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.3.114,PAULINA,It is required
111325,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.3.115,PAULINA,"You do awake your faith. Then all stand still,"
111326,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.3.116,PAULINA,On: those that think it is unlawful business
111327,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.3.117,PAULINA,"I am about, let them depart."
111328,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.3.118,LEONTES,Proceed:
111329,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.3.119,LEONTES,No foot shall stir.
111330,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.120,PAULINA,"Music, awake her, strike!"
111331,A Winters Tale,30.0,,PAULINA,Music
111332,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.121,PAULINA,"'Tis time, descend, be stone no more, approach,"
111333,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.122,PAULINA,"Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,"
111334,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.123,PAULINA,"I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,"
111335,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.124,PAULINA,"Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him"
111336,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.125,PAULINA,Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
111337,A Winters Tale,30.0,,PAULINA,HERMIONE comes down
111338,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.126,PAULINA,"Start not, her actions shall be holy as"
111339,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.127,PAULINA,You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
111340,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.128,PAULINA,"Until you see her die again, for then"
111341,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.129,PAULINA,"You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:"
111342,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.130,PAULINA,"When she was young you woo'd her, now in age"
111343,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.131,PAULINA,Is she become the suitor?
111344,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.3.132,LEONTES,"O, she's warm!"
111345,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.3.133,LEONTES,"If this be magic, let it be an art"
111346,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.3.134,LEONTES,Lawful as eating.
111347,A Winters Tale,32.0,5.3.135,POLIXENES,She embraces him.
111348,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.3.136,CAMILLO,She hangs about his neck:
111349,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.3.137,CAMILLO,If she pertain to life let her speak too.
111350,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.3.138,POLIXENES,"Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,"
111351,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.3.139,POLIXENES,Or how stolen from the dead.
111352,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.3.140,PAULINA,"That she is living,"
111353,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.3.141,PAULINA,"Were it but told you, should be hooted at"
